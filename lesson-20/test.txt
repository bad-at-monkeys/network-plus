CHAPTER 20 TESTS

---
BOOK 20A

1) A cloud service provider is reviewing performance metrics. On a graph,
increases and decreases in customer request volumes are closely
tracked by CPU and RAM provisioning levels. What characteristic of cloud
platforms does this demonstrate?

Elasticity



2) 515accounting uses colocation to host its servers in datacenters
across multiple geographic regions. It configures the servers to run a
software as a service (SaaS) app for use by its employees. What type of
deployment model is this?

Private deployment. The cloud service is wholly operated by 515 (apparently).



3) What type of cloud solution would be used to implement a SAN?

IaaS



4) What are the main options for implementing connections to a cloud
service provider?

Internet/VPN or Direct-connection/Colocation



5) A technician writes a configuration file that specifies the creation of an
Ubuntu Server VM with a 2 GHz CPU, 16 GB RAM, and a mass storage disk
provisioned from a high-speed resource. What type of cloud concept or
model is being used?

Declarative automation





---
BOOK 20B

1) A technician boots a server from USB media and installs a virtualization
product. What type of hypervisor is being used?

Type I



2) If a VM is connected to a bridged virtual switch, what sort of network
access does it have?

The VM is connected to the physical network via the host's NIC.



3) A technician deploys a standard Linux virtual machine and then installs
and configures an open switching OS to run on it. Which virtual network
concept is being deployed?

Network Function Virtualization



4) What role does an initiator play in a SAN and what hardware must be
installed on it?

A file or database server installed with a fibre channel host bus adapter (HBA).



5) What protocol can be used to implement a SAN without provisioning
dedicated storage networking adapters and switches?

iSCSI





---
BOOK 20C

1) A technician is configuring a firewall appliance to work with an SDN
controller. What functionality on the firewall must be enabled?

A southbound API must be configured.



2) A technician is cabling a top-of-rack switch in a spine and leaf
architecture. Each server has been cabled to the switch. What cabling
must the technician add to complete the design?

Fibre Channel



3) True or false? An enterprise WAN can be configured using either MPLS or
SD-WAN, but the two cannot work together.

False. SD-WAN can overlay an existing MPLS VPN.

1) While looking for a cloud deployment model for business operations, the
network specialist looks for a model that a third party hosts for the
organization's exclusive use. Which cloud deployment model meets the network
specialist's and businesses' needs?

Hosted private.



2) A cyber architect is reviewing the topologies that support the east-west
activity for the software-defined networking model. Which topology comprises a
backbone of top-tier switches?

Spine



3) A network architect analyzes the software-defined networking model and reviews
the layer that applies the business logic to decide how to prioritize traffic,
secure data, and where to switch data. What is the appropriate layer for this
description?

Application layer.



4) A network architect analyzes the software-designed networking model and
reviews the layer that exposes an application programming interface (API) that
can be automated by scripts that call functions in the layer above or below.
What is the appropriate layer for this description?

Control Layer



5) While looking for a cloud deployment model for business operations, the
network specialist looks for a model where several organizations share the costs
of either a hosted private or fully private cloud. Which cloud deployment model
meets the network specialist's and businesses' needs?

Community



6) While looking for a cloud deployment model for business operations, the
network specialist looks for a completely private model owned by the
organization. Which cloud deployment model meets the network specialist's and
businesses' needs?

Private. This is wholly owned by the company.



7) While looking for a cloud deployment model for business operations, the
network specialist looks for a model that offers pay-as-you-go financing. Which
cloud deployment model meets the network specialist's and businesses' needs?

Public



8) When configuring connectivity with a virtual switch that bridges the virtual
and physical networks via the host computer's physical NIC, a network engineer
creates a virtual switch that binds to the host's NIC to allow the VM to
communicate on the physical network. What switch did the network engineer create?

External



9) A network consultant is considering what technologies to use when adding a
storage area network (SAN). What are the two most popular SAN connection types?
(Select all that apply.)

Fibre Channel
Fibre Channel over Ethernet



10) While looking for a cloud service model for business, the network specialist
looks for a model that allows the organization to rent components and internet
links on an as-needed basis from the service provider's datacenter. Which cloud
service model meets the network specialist's and businesses' needs?

IaaS



11) A network architect analyzes the software-designed networking model and
reviews the layer that handles the actual forwarding (switching and routing) of
traffic and imposition of ACLs and other policy configurations for security. What
is the appropriate layer for this description?

Infrastructure Layer



12) A network engineer is configuring a switch to make it only usable to the VMs.
The engineer confirms that they cannot use the switch to communicate with the
host. What type of switch is the engineer configuring?

Private.



13) When configuring connectivity with a virtual switch that bridges the virtual
and physical networks via the host computer's physical NIC, a network consultant
creates a virtual switch that creates a bridge that is usable only by VMs on the
host and the host itself. What switch did the network engineer create?

Internal



14) During work, a network specialist uses an IP tunneling protocol to transfer
SCSI data over an IP-based network. iSCSI can be used to link SANs but also is an
alternative to which of the following?

Fibre Channel
