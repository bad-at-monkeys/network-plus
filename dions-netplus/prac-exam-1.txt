Dion Worldwide has recently built a network to connect four offices around the
world together. Each office contains a single centralized switch that all of the
clients connect to within that office. These switches are then connected to two
of the other locations using a direct fiber connection between each office. The
office in New York connects to the London office, the London office connects to
the Hong Kong office, the Hong Kong office connects to the California office, and
the California office connects to the New York office. Which of the following
network topologies best describes the Dion Worldwide network?

Hybrid. This describes a combination of Star and Bus topologies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Port forwarding is an application of NAT that redirects a communication request
from one address and port number combo to another while the packets are traversing
a network gateway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A client has asked you to provide their local office with the BEST solution for a
wireless network based on their requirements. The client has stated that their
users will need a wireless network that provides a maximum of 54 Mbps of

wireless network types should you install to meet their needs?

802.11g provides Tx of up to 54Mbps in the 2.4GHz band.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MIMO uses multiple antennas fro Tx and Rx.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Windows:
nbstat -R purges and reloads the cached name table in the LMHOSTS file on each
client.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the flag used to terminate a connection between two hosts when the sender
believes something has gone wrong with the TCP connection between them?

RST

RST flags are used to terminate a connection.

FIN flags are used to request that a connection be terminated.

SYN flags are set in the first packet sent by a sender to receiver and they
initiate the three-way handshake.

ACK flags are sent back with a SYN flag to acknowledge the sender and initiate a
connection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following is MOST likely to use an RJ-11 connector to connect a
computer to an ISP using a POTS line?

Analog modem.

Analog modems conver the computers digital pulses into tones that can be carried
over analog tele lines and vice versa.

administrator logs into the admin area of the user's access point and discovers
that multiple unknown devices are connected to it. What is MOST likely the cause
of this issue?

A successful WPS attack has occured.

WPS allows users to configure a wireless network without typing a password, and
instead uses a button or 4 digit pin. This is inherently insecure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NAC and GPS can help determine if users that are logging into a network are
physically in the same building as the network they are authenticating on.

Geo-IP can determine the country a host is in.

Network Access Control (NAC) is used to identify an endpoint's characteristics
when conducting network authentication.

GPS location will provide lat/long of the user.

Port security enables the admin to configure individual switch ports to allow only
a specified number of source MAC addresses to communicate using a given
switchport.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are conducting a wireless penetration test against a WPA2-PSK network. Which
of the following types of password attacks should you conduct to verify if the

15 * 8 = 120

There is our answer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An administrator has configured a new 250 Mbps WAN circuit, but a bandwidth speed
test shows poor performance when downloading larger files. The download initially
reaches close to 250 Mbps but begins to drop and show spikes in the download
speeds over time. The administrator checks the interface on the router and sees
the following: DIONRTR01# show interface eth 1/1 GigabitEthernet 1/1 is up, line
is up Hardware is GigabitEthernet, address is 000F.33CC.F13A Configured speed
auto, actual 1Gbit, configured duplex fdx, actual fdx Member of L2 VLAN 1, port
is untagged, port state is forwarding Which of the following actions should be
taken to improve the network performance for this WAN connection?

Assign the interface a 802.1q tag to its own VLAN.

By adding a 802.1q tag (VLAN tag) to its own interface, we can take it off of
the default VLAN and assign it to its own individual VLAN and eliminate potential
overloading and over-subscription issues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the network ID associated with 77.81.12.14/30?

77.81.12.12

In a /30 subnet, there are 4 hosts.

4 * 3 = 12

The Network ID starts at 12.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A technician has finished configuring AAA on a new network device. However, the
technician cannot log into the device with LDAP credentials but can with a local
user account. What is the MOST likely reason for the problem?

Shared secret key is mismatching.

AAA through RADIUS uses a Server Secret Key (a shared secret key).

Secret key mismatches could cause log in problems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A technician is configuring a computer lab for the students at Dion Training.
The computers need to be able to communicate with each other on the internal
network, but students using computers should not be able to access the Internet.
The current network architecture is segmented using a triple-homed firewall to
create the following zones: ZONE INTERFACE, IP address ------------------------
--------------- PUBLIC, eth0, 66.13.24.16/30 INSTRUCTORS, eth1, 172.16.1.1/24
STUDENTS, eth2, 192.168.1.1/24 What rule on the firewall should the technician
configure to prevent students from accessing the Internet?

Deny all traffic from eth2 to eth0.

By denying traffic from eth2 to eth0, we block network traffic from the internal
(STUDENT) network to the external (PUBLIC) network over the WAN connection.

This prevents access to the internet by blocking all requests to the internet.

We can increase the security by blocking eth0 to eth2, which wuld block requests
from the internet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A system administrator wants to verify that external IP addresses cannot collect
software versioning from servers on the network. Which of the following should
the system administrator do to confirm the network is protected?

Level 4 - warning
Level 5 - notice
Level 6 - info
Level 7 - Debugging

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a common technique used by malicious individuals to perform an on-path
attack on a wireless network?

Evil twin is the most common way to preform an on-path attack on a wireless
network.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jason is a network manager leading a project to deploy a SAN. He is working with
the vendor's support technician to set up and configure the SAN on the enterprise
network to begin SAN I/O optimization. What should Jason provide to the vendor
support technician?

Network diagrams.

Since SAN I/O optimization has yet to occur, the support tech should be provided
with a network diagram to physically set the system up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

while causing internal users to route to the website using its internal IP
address?

Implement a split-horizon or split-view DNS.

Split DNS is an implementation in which separate DNS servers are provided for
security and privacy management for internal and external networks.
