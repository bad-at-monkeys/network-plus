SDN Model:

Application layer - business logic/desired config
{Northbound API}  - service interface,SDN controller
Contol layer (SDN Controller) - Control plane,Management Plane
{Southbound API}
Infra - Appliances,Network functions; handles actual forwarding and switching

The OPERATIONAL PLANE implements device state, such
as CPU and memory utilization.

A MANAGEMENT PLANE sits at the same level as the
control plane to interface with the operational plane. This is used to implement
monitoring of traffic conditions and network status.

In other words:

The application layer focuses on the communication resource requests or
information about the network.

The control layer uses the information from applications to decide how to route a
data packet on the network and to make decisions about how traffic should be
prioritized, how it should be secured, and where it should be forwarded to.

The infrastructure layer contains the physical networking devices that receive
information from the control layer about where to move the data and then perform
those movements.

The management plane is used to monitor traffic conditions, the status of the
network, and allows network administrators to oversee the network and gain
insight into its operations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A network technician has just installed a new point-to-point 200-meter
single-mode fiber link between two local routers within the Dion Training
offices. The fiber has been connected to each router, but the interface fails
to come up. The network technician has double-checked the interface
configuration on both routers, both SFPs have been hard looped to confirm they
are functioning, connectors on both ends of the links have been cleaned, and
there is sufficient power. What is the MOST likely cause of the problem?

Wavelength mismatch. This occurs when two different tranceivers are used at each
end of the cable.

If it was a duplex mismatch the link would still show, only performance would be
affected.

You are working as part of a network installation team. Your team has been asked
to install Cat 5e cabling to some new offices on the building's second floor.
Currently, the office only has one network closet, which is located on the first
floor. Your team spent the morning running 24 new CAT 5e cables from a patch
panel in the networking closet on the first floor to a new networking closet you
are outfitting on the second floor. Your team terminated these cables in a new
patch panel in the 2nd-floor closet. You measured the distance from the switch in
the 1st-floor closet to the new 2nd-floor patch panel and determined it was 80
meters. The team then ran cables from this patch panel to each of the new
offices. Some of the offices are working properly, but others are not. You
suspect that some of the cable runs are exceeding the maximum length allowed by
Cat 5e cabling. What is the BEST solution to this problem?

Install a switch in the second-floor networking closet to increase the signal.

An outside organization has completed a penetration test for a company. One of
the report items states that an attacker may have the ability to read TLS traffic
from the webserver due to a software bug. What is the MOST likely mitigation for
this reported item?

Ensure that patches are deployed.

A patch is designed to correct a known bug or fix a known vulnerability. Since
the server is allowing an attacker to read TLS traffic, which should be encrypted
and unreadable, this is a software bug in the webserver's code that must be fixed
using a patch.



You have just received an email regarding a security issue detected on the
company's standard web browser. Which of the following should you do to fix the
issue?

Vulnerability patch.

Since there is a security issue with the current web browser, it most likely
needs to be updated with a manufacturer's vulnerability patch.


The key word here is BROWSER. Since the BROWSER is the issue it isn't a firmware,
OS update, or driver update.

It is a vulnerabilityy patchh on the browser.

Dion Training allows its visiting business partners from CompTIA to use an
available Ethernet port in their conference room to establish a VPN connection
back to the CompTIA internal network. The CompTIA employees should obtain
internet access from the Ethernet port in the conference room, but nowhere else
in the building. Additionally, if any of the Dion Training employees use the same
Ethernet port in the conference room, they should access Dion Training's secure
internal network. Which of the following technologies would allow you to
configure this port and support both requirements?

Implement NAC

Network Access Control (NAC) uses a set of protocols to define and implement a
policy that describes how to secure access to network nodes whenever a device
initially attempts to access the network. NAC can utilize an automatic
remediation process by fixing non-compliant hosts before allowing network access.
Network Access Control can control access to a network with policies, including
pre-admission endpoint security policy checks and post-admission controls over
where users and devices can go on a network and what they can do. In this
scenario, implementing NAC can identify which machines are known and trusted Dion
Training assets and provide them with access to the secure internal network. NAC
could also determine unknown machines (assumed to be those of CompTIA employees)
and provide them with direct internet access only by placing them onto a guest
network or VLAN. While MAC filtering could be used to allow or deny access to the
network, it cannot by itself control which set of network resources could be
utilized from a single ethernet port. A security information and event management
(SIEM) system provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by
applications and network hardware. An access control list could define what
ports, protocols, or IP addresses the ethernet port could be utilized. Still,
it would be unable to distinguish between a Dion Training employee's laptop and a
CompTIA employee's laptop like a NAC implementation could.

information about the connection between two hosts.

Stateful firewall:
Operates at layer 5 (session). Remembers information about existing connections
and uses that to make decisions.

Route poisoning is a method to prevent a router from sending packets through a
route that has become invalid within computer networks to prevent routing loops.
This is achieved by changing the routing metric to a value that exceeds the
maximum allowable hop count so that the advertised router is unreachable.

Split-horizon route advertisement is a method of preventing routing loops in
distance-vector protocols by prohibiting a router from advertising back onto the
interface from which it was learned.

WAFs would detect the accessing of random ports and TLS encryption as suspect.
Application aware firewalls can make decisions about what applications are
allowed or blocked by a firewall. TLS connections are created and maintained by
applications.

Neither Stateful or stateless firewalls operate at layer 6 or 7, so they cannot
inspect TLS sessions.

A network technician is asked to redesign an Ethernet network before some new
monitoring software is added to each network's workstation. The new software
will broadcast statistics from each host to a monitoring server for each of the
company's five departments. The added network traffic is a concern of management
that must be addressed. How should the technician design the new network?

Place each department in a separate VLAN to increase broadcast domains.

We need to increase the broadcast domains due to the increase of broadcast
messages.

Dion Training is afraid that an attacker might try to send other types of 
network traffic over port 80 to bypass their security policies. Which of the
 following should they implement to prevent unauthorized traffic from entering
 through the firewall?

Application aware firewall.

A network technician is tasked with designing a firewall to improve security for
 an existing FTP server on the company network. The FTP server must be 
accessible from the Internet. The security team is concerned that the FTP server
 could be compromised and used to attack the domain controller hosted within the
 company's internal network. What is the BEST way to mitigate this risk?

Migrate the FTP server from the internal network to a screened subnet (DMZ).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following is likely to occur if twenty ethernet clients are
 connected to a hub in a local area network?

Collisions

This will occur because all 20 devices are on the same nnetwork and will collide
once trying to send data at the same time as the other clients.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deauthentication attacks occur when the attacker sends deauthentication frames 
to the victim's machine, once the victim tries to authenticate again the attacker
will attempt to capture the authentication packet and parse information from it.

MTD = longest period of time that a business function outage may occur without
causing irrecoverable business failure.

MTTR = (total repair time / number of incidents)

MTBF = (devices * hrs) / (number of failures)

MTTF = (devices * hrs) / (number of devices)

RPO = the amount of data lost that a system can sustain, measured in time.

T-1 connections are old school copper connections that terminates at a CSU/DSU.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crossover cables connect two like devices.

Straight through cables connect two opposing devices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Duplicate MAC address occurs when two or more devices are responding to data 
requests as if they are the only device on the network with that MAC address.

An indication of this actually happening is when a switch continually changes the
port assignments for that address as it updates its CAM table to reflect the 
physical address and switchport bindings.

This causes the switchports to continually flap by going up and down as entries
are updated in the CAM table.

Asymmetric routing is when network packets leave via one path and return via
a different path.

Asymmetric routing doesn't cause routing issues alone.

The issues occur with dropped packet flows by security devices while employing
asymmetric routing.

Allow HTTP traffic through the 192.168.0.0/24 network:

PERMIT SRCIP:192.168.0.0/24 SRCPORT:ANY DESTIP:ANY DESTPORT:80

This permits traffic from the internal network from any port to access the
external network (any IP) to port 80.

Since we were configuring a stateless fiirewall, we must include SRCPORT ANY
to allow the outbound connection through the firewall.
