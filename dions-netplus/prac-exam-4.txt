You are installing a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network consisting of a
router with 2 ports, a switch with 8 ports, and a hub with 4 ports. The router has
one port connected to a cable modem and one port connected to switch port #1. The
other 6 ports on the switch each have a desktop computer connected to them. The
hub's first port is connected to switch port #2. Based on the description
provided, how many collision domains exist in this network?

9.

Each port on a router is a collision domain = 2
Each port on the switch is a collision domain = 8
The hub is a single collision domain = 1
One switch port is connected to router = -1
The hub and switch also share a collision domain = -1

8 + 1 + 2 = 11 - 2 = 9

Your boss has asked you to select the technology for a new wireless network for
the office. She stated that the new network must allow users to connect their
laptops, smartphones, and tablets wirelessly. The technology selected should
utilize the longest range possible without signal loss. Which of the following
wireless technologies should be selected to meet these requirements?

802.11ac.

802.11ac provides faster speeds and longer coverage ranges than b/g/n.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VoIP or SIP uses port 5060 to get it cracking.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evil twin focuses on access points.
MAC spoofing may work, but would affect the entire network.

ARP poisoning (ARP spoofing) is when an attacker sends falsified ARP messages
over a LAN.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users connecting to an SSID appear to be unable to authenticate to the captive
portal. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of the issue?

RADIUS. The keyword here is AUTHENTICATION. RADIUS is the only listed answer
that authenticates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following technologies is not commonly used by a captive portal to
perform user redirection?

DHCP redirect.

In practice, captive portals are implemeted using HTTP, ICMP, or DNS redirects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MOUs are non-lagally binding

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bluejacking is an actual thing (good guess)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are using an 802.11ac wireless network at your office which uses WPA2-PSK for
encryption. Every few minutes, your wireless connection appears to disconnect and
then quickly reconnect to the network. What type of attack might you be the
victim of?

Deauthentication. This is a DoS attack that targets comms between a user and a
WAP by sending a deauthentication frame to the victims machine. When the user
re-authenticates, the attacker can capture the authentication packet and try to
use that to gain access to something.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember that FTP operates on ports 20 and 21.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A new piece of malware attempts to exfiltrate user data by hiding the traffic and
sending it over a TLS-encrypted outbound traffic over random ports. What
technology would be able to detect and block this type of traffic?

Application aware firewall. This would detect the random access of ports and
suspicious TLS encryption.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EULA is the license agreement at the end of software installs.

AUP is acceptable use policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ethernet standard used with SMF - 10GBase-LR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A technician installs three new switches to a companyâ€™s infrastructure. The
network technician notices that all the switchport lights at the front of each
switch flash rapidly when powered on and connected. After about a minute, the
switches return to normal operation. Additionally, there are rapidly flashing
amber lights on the switches when they started up the next day. What is happening
to the switches?

The switches are running throught the STP process. All lights flashing indicate
that the switch is performing the STP process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYN - sync flag, used to initialte 3-way handshake
ACK - acknowledge, 2nd part of 3-way hshake
RST - reset flag, terminates the connection
FIN - finish flag, requests connection termination

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following occurs when an alert rule has been matched in Snort during
your scan?

The entire packet will be evaluated until all of the IDS alert rules have been
checked and the packet is allowed to continue its journey.

If Snort is operating as an IDS, it won't block the connection or drop the packet,
that is what IPSes do. Snort will essentially evaluate the packet, log any
matches, and let the packet continue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following types of network documentation would include labels to
indicate which cables are connected to which switchports on an edge switch?

Wiring diagram.

Wiring diagrams are used to clearly label which cables are connected to which
ports.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application aware firewalls can make decisions about what applications are allowed
or blocked by a firewall, as opposed to simply using an IP and port numbers.

Application aware firewalls can actually inspect data contained within the
packets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Placing departments in separate VLANs increases broadcast domains, therefore
reducing network congestion from broadcast messages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cable goes over coax.
Fiber is over leased line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following BEST describes how a DHCP reservation works?

DHCP reservation works by matching a MAC address to an IP address within the DHCP
scope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logical network diagrams illustrate the flow of data across a network and is
used to show how devices communicate with each other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

802.11ac utilizes MU-MIMO
802.11n utilizes MIMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firewalls use ACLs.

IDSes use signatures.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMAP uses port 143

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dion Training wants to create a DNS record to specify a host and port to use for
a new instant messaging service. Which type of DNS record should be created?

SRV. A DNS service record specifies a host and port for specific services.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POP3 over SSL uses port 995

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I we enable a discovery protocol on our devices, we can get detailed info directly
from them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frequency jamming is commonly used to exploit and compromise a wireless
environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DHCP snooping is a series of techniques applied to improve the security of a
DHCP infrastructure. It can be used to prevent malicious or malformed DHCP traffic
or rogue DHCP servers from appearing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kerberos is designed to send data over insecure networks while using strong
encryption to protect the information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WPA2-Enterprise requires a RADIUS authentication server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network Access Control (NAC) is a security approach that attempts to unify
endpoint security, user/system authentication, and network security enforcement.
NAC can quarantine any devices out of compliance.

UTM provides multiple security features in one appliance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RPO is the maximum amount of data, measured in time, that an organization is
willing to lose during an outage.

RTO is the duration of time and a service level within which a business process
must be restored after a disaster to avoid unacceptable consequences associated
with business continuity.
