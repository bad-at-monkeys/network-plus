Today, your company's network started to experience network connectivity issues
for various workstations around the company. As you begin troubleshooting, you
identify that all the workstations receive their connectivity from a single
switch on the 3rd floor of the office building. You start searching the 3rd floor
for the cause of this issue and find a small wired router plugged into a network
jack in the sales manager's office. From this small wired router, he has
connected his workstation and a small Smart TV to watch Netflix while working.
You question the sales manager about when he brought in the new router. He states
that he just hooked it up this morning. What type of issue did the sales manager
accidentally introduced into the network by installing the router?

Rogue DHCP server. Introducing a new, unknown router directly to the network
also introduces a new unknown DHCP server. Hence, rogue DHCP server.

his position, Jason has access to sensitive company data, which might be stored
on his cell phone during its usage. The company is concerned about this but
believes that it might be acceptable with the proper security controls in place.

passes over a trunk?

It becomes the default VLAN for untagged frames.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VLAN information?

VTP. VLAN Trunking Protocol allows a VLAN created on one switch to be propogated
to other switches on a group of switched within a VTP domain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A network administrator is tasked with building a wireless network in a new
building located next door to your company's office building. The wireless
clients should not be able to communicate with other wireless clients but should
be able to communicate with any wired users on the network. The users must be
able to seamlessly migrate between the buildings while maintaining a constant
connection to the LAN. How should the administrator configure the new wireless
network in this new building?

Use the same SSIDs on different channels and AP isolation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A network technician has just installed a new point-to-point 200-meter
single-mode fiber link between two local routers within the Dion Training
offices. The fiber has been connected to each router, but the interface fails
to come up. The network technician has double-checked the interface
configuration on both routers, both SFPs have been hard looped to confirm they
are functioning, connectors on both ends of the links have been cleaned, and
there is sufficient power. What is the MOST likely cause of the problem?

Wavelength mismatch. This occurs when two different tranceivers are used at each
end of the cable.

If it was a duplex mismatch the link would still show, only performance would be
affected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are working as part of a network installation team. Your team has been asked
to install Cat 5e cabling to some new offices on the building's second floor.
Currently, the office only has one network closet, which is located on the first
floor. Your team spent the morning running 24 new CAT 5e cables from a patch
panel in the networking closet on the first floor to a new networking closet you
are outfitting on the second floor. Your team terminated these cables in a new
patch panel in the 2nd-floor closet. You measured the distance from the switch in
the 1st-floor closet to the new 2nd-floor patch panel and determined it was 80
meters. The team then ran cables from this patch panel to each of the new
offices. Some of the offices are working properly, but others are not. You
suspect that some of the cable runs are exceeding the maximum length allowed by
Cat 5e cabling. What is the BEST solution to this problem?

Install a switch in the second-floor networking closet to increase the signal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following is a security concern with using a cloud service provider
and could result in a data breach caused by data remnants?

enables an interface to retain dynamically learned MAC addresses when the switch
is restarted or if the interface goes down and is brought back online.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a switchport is configured for 802.1q trunking instead of as an access host
port, the workstation will be unable to reach the DHCP server through the port
and will fall back to using an APIPA address.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In AAA using LDAP, we are using a RADIUS server. AAA through RADIUS uses a
Server Secret Key. If the keys mismatch thhere could be login issues.

Barbara has connected her personal wireless router to a network jack inside her
office. The router cannot get a DHCP address even though her corporate laptop can
get a DHCP address when connected to the same jack. Barbara checked the router's
configuration to ensure it is set up to obtain a DHCP address. Which of the
following is the MOST likely reason that the router is not getting a DHCP
address?

Only allow listed MAC addresses can connect to the network.
