--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Piggybacking is actually tricking an employee for access, tailgating is following
an ignorant employee for access.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

alert conditions:
0 - emergency
1 - alert
2 - critical
3 - error
4 - warning
5 - notice
6 - info
7 - debugging

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a connection between two buildings, a low-profile directional patchh antenna
should be used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A company is setting up a brand new server room and would like to keep the cabling
infrastructure out of sight but still accessible to the network administrators.
Infrastructure cost is not an issue. Which of the following should be installed to
meet the requirements?

Raised floor. This is the most expensive, low-profile option that network admins
still have access to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol on port 5060/5061 for
initiating, maintainging, and terminating real-time sessions that include voice,
video, and messaging applications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jitter is a network condition that occurs when a time delay in the sending of
data packets over a network connection occurs. Voice speeding up and slowing
down is a sign of jitter.

Latency is measured in round-trip time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which type of wireless network utilizes the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands and
reaches speeds of 108 Mbps to 600 Mbps?

802.11n.

This standard utilizes a 2.4GHz freq @ 108Mbps and a 5GHz freq @ 600Mbps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DB-9 connectors are used with RS-232 serial standards.

Token rings use fiber optic cables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using the 2.4GHz spectrum, we must use channels 1 6 11.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A network architect is designing a highly redundant network with a distance
vector routing protocol to prevent routing loops. The architect wants to
configure the routers to advertise failed routes with the addition of an infinite
metric. What should the architect configure to achieve this?

Route poisoning is a method to prevent a router from sending packets through a
route that has become invalid. The route is poisoned by changing the route's
metric value to one that exceeds the maximum allowable hop count. This would
result in a "Destination unreachable" type error.

Split-horizon does prevent routing loops, but the question only mentions this. It
doesn't specifically ask.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What should we do to block employees from accessing a bad webpage from a spear-
fishing attack?

Add http://www.malware-site.com:8080/claim.php to the browser's group policy
blocklist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POP3 uses port 110

POP3+SSL uses port 993

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An attacker is using double tagging to conduct a network exploit against your
enterprise network. Which of the following types of attacks is being conducted?

VLAN hopping. This is where an attacker is able to send traffic from one VLAN
into another by either double tagging the traffic or conducting switch spoofing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

802.1q - VLAN tagging
802.3af - PoE
802.1x - wireless encryption/auth on RADIUS
802.1d - STP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IaC utilizes runbooks to generate consisten server builds across an enterprise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A technician needs to limit the amount of broadcast traffic on a network and
allow different segments to communicate. Which of the following should the
technician install to satisfy this requirement?

Add a multilayer switch and create a VLAN. We knew this, but adding a MLS
and a VLAN to the network would increase routing performance and reduce broadcast
traffic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CIA Triad

This is a security model.

Confidentiality
Integrity
Availablity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POTS is connected to almost every facility in the united states.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LDAPS uses port 636.
LDAP uses port 389.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What happens when convergence on a routed network occurs?

All routers learn the route to all connected networks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which of the following security features should be enabled to configure a quality
of service filter to manage the traffic flow of a Cisco router or switch and
protect it against a denial-of-service attack?

Control plane policing. This is a technology on Cisco IOS routers and switches
that allow users to configure a QoS filter.

If we see QoS and Cisco together, the answer will be control plane policing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10GBase-SR is a 10Gb Ethernet LAN standard for use with MMF cables using short-
wavelengthh signaling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A company needs to implement stronger authentication by adding an authentication
factor to its wireless system. The wireless system only supports WPA with
pre-shared keys, but the back-end authentication system supports EAP and TTLS.
What should the network administrator implement?

802.1x using PAP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In SDN, the management plane is used to monitor traffic conditions, the status of
the network, and allows admins to oversee the network and gain insight into its
operations.
