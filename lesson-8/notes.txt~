LESSON 8 - EXPLAINING NETWORK TOPOLOGIES AND TYPES


---
Client-Server vs Peer-to-Peer Networks

Client-server networks is one in which servers provision, store and manage
applications and services. Then those applications and services are served
to clients over a network.


Peer-to-Peer networks are ones in which end systems act as both server and
client.The administration of these aapplications and services are distributed
around the network.

Network Types

LANs
Local area networks are internal networks all directly connected in some way.
They can act independent of the external internet through internal resources.


WANs
Wide Area Networks link remote networks. WANs are likely to use leased lines
and equipment to connect these networks together.


PANs
Personal Area Networks are ones where an individual or system interconnects
the devices within a certain proximity. Think of a bunch of bluetooth devices
streaming data to a central server or a person wearing devices that monitor
health data and send that data to a local server that forwards the data to the
internet.





---
Network Topology

Describes the physical or logical structure of the network in terms of nodes
and links.



Point-to-point - When only two devices isolate a resource or service to
another, which guarantees a level of bandwidth between them.





---
Star Topology

Each endpoint node is connected to a central forwarding node.

Hub-and-spoke topologies are just star topologies that extend to remote sites
through a WAN.





---
Mesh Topology

Commonly used in WANs like the Internet.

In theory most fully mesh networks are impossible because the number of nodes
we need is n(n-1)/2:

4 nodes = 6 links
40 nodes = 680 links

So partial mesh networks are used, where each node has redundant or more links
to other devices but learn about the full topology through convergennce.





---
Ring Topology

Each node is wired to its neighbor in a closed loop. Tokens are used by nodes
to pass data into the loop. Each node int the loop forwards this token until
it reaches the intended destination.

This isn't implemented with LANs, but two-ring systems are implemented in WANs.





---
Bus Topology

All nodes share the bandwitdth of the media. Only one node can be active at any
one time. All nodes attach to a single cable segment via taps. The bus is
terminated at both ends to absorb the signal once it has passed through all
nodes.

A fault anywhere in the cable means noone can communicate.





---
Hybrid Topology

Anything that uses a mixture of topologies.

Hierarchical Star - A tree structure where a devices is up top,
                    and this branches out to seperate nodes that then
		    branch out to more seperate nodes.

Hierarchical Star-mesh - A tree, but at the top is a mesh of devices.

Star of Stars - WANs may be like this. Hub-and-spoke.

Star w/ Ring - A ring connecting sites that then implement a star structure.

Explain Tiered Switching Architecture

---
Three Tiered Network Hierarchy

Access, Distribution, Core

The hierarchy:
  -> WAN router/FWs sit in top
  -> Layer 3 core switches here.
  -> layer 3 distribution switches here. 10Gbps down/40Gbps up
  -> workgroup switches. 1Gbps


The workgroup switces form star topologies with clients,
the core and distribution switches have reduundant links with another.





---
Spanning Tree Protocol

Layer2 uses STP to create redundant links between switches while preventing
loops.

The switches form a hierarchy:
  -> The root bridge sits at the top. This is the switch with the lowest ID,
     which comprises of a priority value and the oldest mac address out of all
     devices.
  -> Using BDPUs the switches determine the lowest cost path to the root bridge.
  -> Ports that forward up to the root bridge are root ports.
  -> Ports that forward down the network are designated ports.
  -> Ports that cause loops are blocking/non-designated.
  -> Changes to the topology are communicated and the network state will adjust
     accordingly.





---
STP Config

STP is almost automatic. The admin should set priority on each switch.

When all ports are in forwarding or blocking states, the network is converged.
When the network is not converged, no communications can take place.





---
Switching Loop and Broadcast Storm Issues

Flooded frames circulate the network endlessly. Because switches broadcast ARP
or DHCP requests out of all ports, the frames will go down one link to the
next switch. This switch sends the broadcast back down the redundant link to
the originating switch. These switches start to see dource MACs associated with
mulitple ports and so they clear the MAC address mapping, this causes them to
start flooding unicast traffic as well.

When nothing is done, this is called a broadecast storm.


STP shuts down the port if this occurs.

To resolve the issue, check the ports that STP blocked and see what they
correspond to physically on the switch or patch panel.

Check events related to MAC address flapping.
