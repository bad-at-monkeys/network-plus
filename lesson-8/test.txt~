LESSON 8 TEST - EXPLAINING NETWORK TOPOLOGIES AND TYPES

---
BOOK 8A

1) What network infrastructure implementation links multiple buildings
within the same city?

MAN; Metro Area Network.



2) What term is used to describe a topology in which two nodes share a
single link?

Point-to-point



3) You need operations to continue if one link fails. How many links does it
take to connect three sites?

n(n-1)/2 = 3*2/2 = 3



4) What types of devices are connected in a PAN?

Bluetooth devices typically. Phones, laptops, wearables, etc.

BOOK 8B

1) Which two topologies are used in the three-tier hierarchical model?

(Partial) Mesh and star.



2) Spanning tree has been deployed without the administrator setting a
priority value. Which of the following switches will be selected as the
root?
• Switch A with base MAC f062.81ff.0001 and a 10 Gbps uplink
• Switch B with base MAC f062.81ff.0002 and a 40 Gbps uplink
• Switch C with base MAC f062.81ff.0003 and a 40 Gbps uplink

Switch A. It has the lowest value MAC.



3) In what STP-configured state(s) are all ports when a network running STP
is converged?

Forwarding or blocking.



4) True or false? A broadcast storm can only be resolved by investing
interface configurations.

False. Broadcast storms can only be caused by improper cabling.

Explain VLANs

VLAN IDs and Membership

At the data link and network layers, a group of hosts in the same broadcast
domain is a segment.

At the network layer this is identified as an IP network or as a subnet within
an IP network.


VLANs are used to isolate ports on a switch by virtually separating them into
different broadcast domains.

Networks are typically designed as a 1:1 mapping between subnet and VLAN ID.

The default ID is VLAN 1.
We can configure ports on the switch from 2-4094.

Communications between VLANs must be done through a router or layer3 switch.
