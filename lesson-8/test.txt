LESSON 8 TEST - EXPLAINING NETWORK TOPOLOGIES AND TYPES

---
BOOK 8A

1) What network infrastructure implementation links multiple buildings
within the same city?

MAN; Metro Area Network.



2) What term is used to describe a topology in which two nodes share a
single link?

Point-to-point



3) You need operations to continue if one link fails. How many links does it
take to connect three sites?

n(n-1)/2 = 3*2/2 = 3



4) What types of devices are connected in a PAN?

Bluetooth devices typically. Phones, laptops, wearables, etc.

BOOK 8B

1) Which two topologies are used in the three-tier hierarchical model?

(Partial) Mesh and star.



2) Spanning tree has been deployed without the administrator setting a
priority value. Which of the following switches will be selected as the
root?
• Switch A with base MAC f062.81ff.0001 and a 10 Gbps uplink
• Switch B with base MAC f062.81ff.0002 and a 40 Gbps uplink
• Switch C with base MAC f062.81ff.0003 and a 40 Gbps uplink

Switch A. It has the lowest value MAC.



3) In what STP-configured state(s) are all ports when a network running STP
is converged?

Forwarding or blocking.



4) True or false? A broadcast storm can only be resolved by investing
interface configurations.

False. Broadcast storms can only be caused by improper cabling.

Book 8C

1) At which layer of the OSI model do VLANs establish network segments?

Layer2. VLANs operate on Layer2.



2) True or false? A VLAN is a single broadcast domain.

True. Each LAN is on its own broadcast domain, so if they are virtually
separated, the same rules apply.



3) Which values can be used to assign a port to a specific VLAN?

From 2-4094. Thhe default ID, VLAN ID 1 (0 and 4095)  is reserved and the
default value for all uncofigured ports.



4) What type of frames are carried over tagged ports?

802.1q



5) True or false? When configuring a voice VLAN, the voice VLAN ID must be
lower than the access VLAN ID.

False. The IDs only need to be distinct and sync'd with the IDs expected
by the switch.

ONLINE

1) A network architect is reviewing a network where application services and
resources are centrally provisioned, managed, and secured. What is this called?

Client-server.



2) A network administrator is determining untagged port logic for a frame
addressed to a port in the same VLAN on the same switch. What would happen?

No tag is added. If the frame gets addressed to a port in the same VLAN
on the same switch, no tag is necessary.

If the frame is being forwarded over the trunk port then a tag must be added.



3) A network technician is studying a network topology where each node
wires to its neighbor in a closed loop. What is this called?

Ring. This is exactly what a ring topology is.



4) A network architect is researching VLAN IDs (VID) for each frame, to
preserve them for the receiving switch to forward them correctly. The network
architect should look at which standard?

802.1q



5) A network technician does not have enough ports on a single switch and has
to connect multiple switches. What should the technician research for
interconnections between switches?

Trunks. Trunks are what interconnect switches. One port on each switch should
be configured as trunk portts with the 802.1q protocol.



6) A network operator is reviewing a network topology where all nodes share
the bandwidth of the media. What is this called?

Bus.



7) A network engineer is looking at a local area network (LAN) which uses
structured cabling, two 24-port switches and a router to provide connectivity.
What type of LAN is this most likely?

SME. Small and medium enterprise networks.



8) A network administrator is setting up Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)
for various segments, such as voice and data. Which of the following IDs is
the default VLAN?

VLAN 1.



9) A network administrator is looking at a switch where the network is not
converged. What does this mean?

Regular communications are not taking place. No communications can take place
if the network isn't converged.



10) A security architect is looking over network topologies where each endpoint
node connects to a central forwarding node. What is this called?

Star.



11) A network administrator is looking at a network where network utilization
approaches maximum capacity, and the CPU utilization of the switches jumps to
80 percent or more. What is this called?

Broadcast Storm.



12) A network administrator is trying to figure out which switch will be rooted
in a spanning tree protocol set up. Which of the following would determine the
root?

Lowest ID. This comprises of a priority value and the MAC. The switch with
the earliest manufacturing date in the MAC address is chosen by default.



13) A network architect is reviewing the architecture for a large company.
Which of the following tiers is NOT part of the traditional three-tiered
network hierarchy?

Bus. This is a topology design, not a part of the three-tier hierarchy.



14) A network analyst is looking at traffic from switches to other switches,
which determines the shortest path. What is this called?

BDPU. Bridge Protocol Data Units are the multicast frames that communicate
STP information, which includes thhe shortest path.



15) A network administrator wants to set up a switch with a voice or auxiliary
Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) to distinguish the PC and VoIP traffic
without having to set up a trunk port. Which of the following commands should
the administrator perform first?

interface GigabitEthernet0/0

This is typically always amongst the first commands when configuring an
interface on a switch. The other commands don't come until later.
