BOOK TESTS

3A

1) You need to run UTP cable between two switches at opposite ends of a
warehouse that is 140 m (459 feet) long. What additional device (if any) is
required for the installation to be compliant with 1000BASE-TX Ethernet
standard?

UTP cables can run a maximum of 100m so a repeater is necessary.



2) T or F. All the nodes on a hub are on the same collision domain?

True. All nodes on a hub are on the same bradcast and collision domains.



3) True or False? A computer with a 10BASE-T Ethernet adapter cannot be
joined to a 100BASE-T network.

False. Fast Ethernet is backwards compatible with 10BASE-T.
Gigabit internet is backwards compatible with Fast Ethernet.



4) True or False? Devices can only transmit on an Ethernet network when
the media is clear, and the opportunity to transmit becomes less
frequent as more devices are added. Also, the probability of collisions
increases. These problems can be overcome by installing a hub.

False. We should implement a switch here.



5) True or false? A bridge does not forward broadcast traffic.

False. A bridge has separate collision domains for its segments, but
has the same broadcst domains.

3B

1) True or False? The CRC mechanism in Ethernet allows for the
retransmission of damaged frames.

False. CRC simply checks to see if the frame is corrupt.



2) What is an I/G bit?

The bit in a frame that determines whether the frame goes to an
individual or group.


3) What is an MTU?

The Maximum Transmission unit is the maximum size of the frame payload
that maxes out at 1500.



4) On a switched network, what configuration changes must be made to
allow a host to sniff unicast traffic from all hosts connected to a switch?

The switch must be configured to mirror traffic on the sniffer's port.



Write the command to use tcpdump to capture traffic from the IP address 172.16.16.254 on the
interface eth0 and output the results to the file router.pcap.

$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w 'router.pcap' src host 172.16.16.254

3C

1) You need to verify whether a switch port is misconfigured by checking
the number of collisions being reported. What general command could
you use at a CLI to report this information?

# sh interface



2) True or false? A managed switch should have auto MDI/MDI-X enabled by
default.

True.



3) A technician configures a switch port with a list of approved MAC
addresses. What type of feature has been enabled?

Port security.



4) A server has a four-port gigabit Ethernet card. If a switch supports port
aggregation, what bandwidth link can be achieved?

4x1 gigabit.



5) What port configuration feature allows a server to smooth incoming
traffic rates?

IEEE 802.3x Flow control



6) Can you safely connect a server to a PoE+ enabled port or should you
disable PoE first?

We can connect the server. PoE detects whether to supply power to the device.

ONLINE

1) A network technician wants to upgrade the company's hub to avoid collisions.
Which solution would help the technician accomplish this to the fullest extent?

Switch



2) A help desk operator is trying to identify the vendor for a piece of
equipment. What could the help desk operator check to determine the vendor?

OUI



3) A server administrator needs to allow a server to instruct the switch to
pause traffic temporarily to avoid overwhelming its buffer and causing it to
drop frames. What should the server administrator set up?

Flow Control



4) A network engineer is setting up MTU sizes to follow most Ether products.
In normal conditions, what is the maximum size of a standard Ethernet frame,
excluding the preamble?

1518bytes



5) Due to budgetary restraints, a systems administrator is setting up servers
with standard network interface cards (NICs) using the most cost-effective
methods. Which of the following do most standard NICs support?

Fast Ethernet
Gigabit Ethernet



6) A network technician has set up a link where the cable length exceeds the
distance limitation and may not achieve the required speed or be unreliable.
What should the network technician use in this case?

Repeater.



7) A systems administrator is trying to troubleshoot frames moving over a 10
gigabit network and wants to set up the most optimal solution. Which of the
following should the sysadmin use?

Active tap. This is most optimal, gigabit signaling is too complex for
passive tap.



8) A network architect is assessing network performance. Which of the following
is part of the CSMA/CD protocol to identify collisions early?

Preamble
SFD



9) A network technician wants to upgrade the company's hub to isolate collision
domains from each other and allow for Gigabit Ethernet. Which solution would
help the technician to accomplish this?

Switch



10) A networking administrator is trying to power off a Cisco switch, but it
is not working. The administrator needs to be in which mode to perform this
task?

Privelaged EXEC Mode/Enable Mode. Both of these modes allow the user to
power off the device.



11) A network technician is setting up a connection between switches, but
the switches cannot establish a connection. Which of the following would be
the most likely cause of the switch's inability to establish a connection?

Dual MDI-X ports



12) A network administrator is setting up connection points for multiple
devices to connect. Which of the following cannot be configured?

Hub, they have no config options.



13) A systems administrator needs to combine multiple 1 Gbps connections to
be able to support 2 Gbps connections. What should the administrator set up?

NIC Teaming



14) A cable operator needs to transition from one cable type to another.
Which of the following would best help?

Media Converter



15) A networking project manager needs switches that can connect together and
operate as a group. Which of the following should the project manager use?

Stackable
