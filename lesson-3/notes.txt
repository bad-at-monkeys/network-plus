Repeaters, Media Converters, amd Hubs

Repeaters amplify signals over copper or fiber cables of the same media type
to overcome great distances. They are transparent to the network, always on,
and represent a single point of failure on the network.


Hubs are half-duplex repeaters with all ports on the same collision and
broadcast domains. On hubs, the Tx wires on the host connect to the Rx wires
on the hub. This is called Media Dependent Interface Croossover MDI-X.


Media converters are layer1 devices that connect two cables of differing
media types together and convert the signals to the respective media type.





---
Bridges and Layer2 Switches

Bridges are Layer2 devices that separate hubs into their own collision domains,
but are kept in the same broadcast domain. This isolates each hub network so that
they don't slow down or contend with eachother but still allows each collision
domain to communicate with another, creating a single logical network.

Bridges build MAC address tables to track which addresses go to which ports.
This table is flushed to stay up to date. If no record of a hardware address
or the frame is a broadcast or multicast, then the bridge floods the all
network segments except the sender.



Layer2 switches have each port on a separate collision domain, so collisions
can only occur if the port is operating in half-duplex mode for legacy
applications.

EXPLAIN NETWORK INTERFACES

Network Interface Cards

NICs physically connect a node to a transmission media supporting all media
type, although they must be specially provisioned for fiber. A NIC may
provision multiple ports on the same card, aggregating two separate networks
on the same card creating a high bandwidth channel.

Each interface has its own MAC address or EUI.

Ethernet Frame Format

| Preamble | SFD | Dest MAC | Source MAC | Ether Type | Payload | FCS |


Preamble and Start Frame Delimiter(SFD)
Used for clock synchronization and as a part of CSMA/CD to identify collisions.
Not technically part of the frame.


Error Checking(CRC or FCS)
The Cyclic Redundancy check is a 32-bit(4-byte) checksum also known as the
Frame Check Sequence(FCS). CRC is calculated based on frame contents, the
sender and receiver use the same calculation and if it matches then the
frame is accepted. CRC doesn't retransmit and isn't wholly error proof.





---
Media Access Control Format

MAC addresses are 48-bit(6-byte) identifiers displayed as 6 groups of 2
hexadecimal digits with colon or hyphen separators.


Burned in Addresses
MAC addresses are coded into the hardware with IDs distributed by the IEEE.
  -> The first 3 octets are the Organizationally Unique ID(OUI)
  -> The last 3 octets are a serial

Organizations can decide to use locally administered MACs to make it easier
to identify devices on the network and where they are in the topology.
A locally administered MAC is defined by changing the U/L bit to 1.


Broadcast Address
The I/G bit of a MAC determines whether the frame is addressed to an individual
node(0) or a group(1). Group frames are obviously used for broadcast and
multicast transmissions. ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff (all 1's) is the broadcast address
and is processed by all nodes within the same broadcast domain.





---
Frame Length and MTU

A 2-byte field in a frame specifies the size of the payload. The payload can
typically have 46-1500bytes, the upper limit of that being the MTU (whatever
it is configured as on the device).

Type II frames are most common and they actually use this field to describe
the layer3 protocol caontained in the frame.

To comply with CSMA/CD the minimum length of an Ethernet frame is 64-bytes,
so the payload must be atleast 46-bytes, if not it is automatically padded
with redundant data.

1518-bytes is the maximum size of a frame excluding the preamble.





---
Packet Sniffers and Taps

Protocol analyzers depend on packet sniffers because that is what captures
the frames and packets moving through the network.

There are three main options for connecting a sniffer to the appropriate
point in the network:
  -> SPAN(switched port analyser)/mirror port
       The sensor is attached to a specially configured port on the switch
       that receives copies of frames addressed to nominated ports.
       This isn't reliable.
  -> Passive Test access point(TAP)
       Essentially a box with ports in and out and an inductor or optical
       splitter that physically copies the signal from the cabling to a
       monitor port. The monitor receives every frame (even corrupt) and
       isn't affected by load.
  -> Active TAP
       Powered device that performs signal regeneration. Gigabit signalling
       is too much for a passive TAP. Because it is a powered device, it is
       a single point of failure given an outage.





---
tcpdump

Packet capture utility for Linux providing the user interface for the libcap
library:

$ sudo tcpdump -i [interface]

The -w and -r optiions write output to files and reads it respectively.

The -v, -vv, -vvv is used for detail.

The -e switch shows the Ethernet header.


tcpdump is often used with filter expressions:
  -> Type; filter by host, net, port, or port range
  -> Direction; filter by src or dst host, network or port
  -> Protocol; filter by a named protocol instead of port number

Booleans are legal in a tcpdump statement:
  -> and (&&)
  -> or (||)
  -> not (!)


Pranthesis can be used to group expressions for precedence, complex expressions
should be enclosed in double quotes:

$ tcpdump -i eth0 "src host 10.1.0.100 and (dst port 53 or dst port 80)"

This command filters frames with source ip 10.1.0.100 and destination port
53 or 80.

Wireshark

Wireshark is a graphical protocol analyzer and packet sniffer combining
tcpdump and nmap.

DEPLOY COMMON ETHERNET SWITCHING FEATURES

Ethernet Switch Types

Ethernet switches can be differentiated by the following generalites:
  -> Unmanaged vs Managed
       On a SOHO network switches are more likely to be unmanaged and added to
       the network without configuration. The switch may also be built into a
       router or modem on the appliance.
       On a corporate network, switches are going to be managed. This means
       that the switches can be configured accordingly.
  -> Stackable
       Switches that cann be connected together and act as a group.
       The stack can be managed as a single unit.
  -> Desktop vs Rack Mounted
       Small switches can be placed on a table.
       Rack mounted switches are mounted into standardized cabinets.





---
Switch Interface Configuration

Cisco IOS modes:
  -> User EXEC mode; read-only, used to view output data and troubleshoot.
  -> Privelaged EXEC mode/enable mode; allows reboot and shutdown and write
     configuration updates.
  -> Global config; can write configuration updates.

Show commands:
  -> sh config, sh startup-config, sh running-config
  -> sh int

In most cases, the port on the switch is set to autonegotiate speed
(10/100/1000) and full- or half-duplex operation.

Static configurations are applied manually if necessary.





---
Auto MDI/MDI-X

    TO|
FROM__|      MDI        MDI-X        Auto MDI-X

MDI          crossover  straight     any
MDI-X        straight   crossover    any
Auto MDI-X   any        any          any


End systems use MDI. MDI transmits on pins 1/2 and receives on 3/6.
Switches use MDI-X. MDI-X transmits on pins 3/6 and receives on 1/2.
The cable between these two systems must be a straight cable.

When a like devices are connected to another, a crossover cable is used.

Now days pretty much everything uses Auto MDI-X.





---
MAC Address Table and Port Security

A switch learns MACs by reading the source portion of a frame when it is
received on a port. The adress mappings are stored on a MAC table in the
switches cache memory.

The address table is implemented as content addressable memory(CAM). This
type of memory is designed to search, not for random access.

MAC table = CAM table

Entries stay on the MAC table for a certain period and then are flushed,
so that the switch can update the table.

If a MAC cannot be found on the table, the switch floods the network by
transmitting the frame out of all the ports except for the source.

Viewing a MAC address table:
# show mac address-table dynamic


A port security configuration validates the MAC address of end systems that
connect to a switchport. Unknown or frequently changing MACs on a hosts could
indicate intrusion. There are two elements of a port security:
  -> Specify a static MAC address or allow the port to learn and accept a
     certain number of sticky addresses.
  -> Specify an enforcement action when a policy violation is detected.





---
Port Aggregation

Combining two or more separate cabled links into a single logical channel.
On the host end, this is called NIC teaming.

For example, a network adapter and cable segment may support 1Gbps;
aggregating this with another adapter and cable pair yields a link of 2Gbps.

Link Aggregation Control Protocol(LACP) implements port aggregation. LACP
can be used to autonegotiate the aggregated link between the switch ports and
the end system, detect configuration errors, and recover from the failure of
one of the physical links.





---
Port Mirroring

A switch forwards unicast traffic only to the specific port connected to the
intended destination interface. This prevents sniffing of unicast traffic by
hosts attached to the same switch.


Capturing and analyzing network traffic is essential for engineers, so port
mirroring provides the way to do this.

Port mirroring copies all packets sent to one or more source ports to a
mirror (destination) port. On Cisco, this is called a Switch Port Analyzer
(SPAN).


The mirror port will be managed by a packet sniffer, network analyzer, or IDS.





---
Jumbo Frames and Flow Control

Hosts that push a lot of data can be configured for flow control
and jumbo frames.


Jumbo Frames
Standard Ethernat frames max out at 1500-byte MTU. Jumbo frames support data
payloads of up to around 9,000-bytes.

Jumbo frames may help save on processing and bandwidth.

To see the MTU value of an interface:
# show interface



Flow Control 802.3x

Flow control allows a server to instruct the switch to pause traffic
temporarily to avoid overwhelming its buffer and prevent dropped frames.
Switchports can be configured to enable or disable PAUSE frames. The 802.3x
global PAUSE mechanis, does not distinguish between traffic types, which may
cause issues with voice/video infra.

Class of Service(CoS) and Quality of Service(QoS) ensure reliable performance
for time-sensitive applications by marking and policing traffic. The updated
priority flow control(PFC) mechanism allows PAUSE frames to apply to certain
traffic classes only.



---
PoE 802.3-2018

This is a way to supply electrical power from a switch port over oridinary
data cabling to a connected powered device(PD).

PoE is described in 802.3-2018:
  -> 802.3af: 13W, 350mA@48V
  -> 802.3at(PoE+): 25W, max current 600mA.
  -> 802.3bt(Ultra PoE): 51W(type3) or 73A(type4)


If a device doesn't support PoE, a power injector can be used in its place.

When connected to a PoE device, the switch will determine if PoE is enabled.
