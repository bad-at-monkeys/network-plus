LAB 14 - LESSON 11 ANALYZE APPLICATION SECURITY CONFIGURATIONS

We observe the hmailserver and will use it to facilitate mail between clients.

We launch wireshark and start capture on:
port 25 or port 143 or port 53    (SMTP IMAP DNS)

You will not see SMTP traffic but you will see IMAP traffic for the email client.
The client is not configured for POP3, so don't expect any of that traffic to
appear.


Filter for DNS packets, note that they are transported over UDP.


Now filter  tcp.port == 143

We can see that IMAP is TCP.

Inspect the IMAP packets for Request: 3 login...
We should see the sull email address and password unencrypted.


Which of the following is a way to mitigate the threat of packet sniffing
against email traffic?

HTTPS web mail


How are IMAP and POP3 different from SMTP?

IMAP and POP3 are client email retrieval protocols, SMTP is primarily an
email transfer protocol
