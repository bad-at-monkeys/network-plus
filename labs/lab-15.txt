LAB 15 - CONFIGURE SECURE ACCESS CHANNELS

We are configuring SSH here. Let's pay extra close attention to how the key pairs
are shared.

We should start adopting the habit of backing up our configuration files before
altering them in a destructive manner, for example:

$ cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config ~/config-backups/ssh/sshd_config_old

We save it to the user's directory in a special directory for old configs so that
we can revert whenevs.



Configure key-based authentication

The client has a private and public key, we must copy the client's public key to
the server:

On the client, generate an SSH keypair:
$ ssh-keygen

Then copy the public key to the server:
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user01@10.1.16.9

Confirm:
$ ssh user01@10.1.16.9



Prevent root from authenticating over ssh

Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
  -> disable root user access
  -> disable passwords over ssh



Review the ssh log file

Generate an entry in the /var/log/messages file:
$ sudo tail /var/log/auth.log.1 | grep -i ssh
