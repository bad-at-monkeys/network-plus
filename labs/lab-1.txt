LAB 01 - CONFIGURE A SOHO ROUTER

On Ubuntu 18.04 we are going to connect a SOHO router through SSH,
establish an HTTP connection and manage it.

1) Login and go to Network Manager in the toolbar,
   -> eth1 -> wired settings -> eth1 gear icon -> ipv4

   We can see that DHCP is being used.



2) Open the terminal:
   $ ip addr show eth1



3) SSH into the OpenWRT router
   $ ssh root@192.168.1.1

   Show basic info about the router and find the LAN and WAN interfaces:
   $ uci show network
   $ uci show network | grep -i "network.wan.ifname"
   $ uci show network | grep -i "network.lan.ifname"



4) View network info again:
   $ ifconfig



5) Open firefox and enter the routers IP in the address bar:
   http://192.168.1.1

   We are just creating a stronger admin password for the router.



6) Logout and log back into the router. We can see the sytems overview here,
   this includes DHCP leases and system utilization as well.



7) If we go to System -> Logging, we can input a server IP to send logs to.



8) We need to configure SSH to listen only on the LAN interface on port 22
   System -> Administration -> SSH Access -> Interface

   Then save that.



9) Open a terminal and attempt a connection to the router:
   $ ssh root@192.168.1.1

   The connection is successful.



9) Change the interface from LAN to WAN in the SSH configuration,
   then try an ssh connection in the terminal.

   It should fail.



10) We can create backups of the router config.



NOTE: There are three private IP address ranges:
    Reserved Class A 10.x.y.z
    Reserved Class B 172.16.x.y - 172.31.x.y
    Reserved Class C 192.168.x.y

NOTE: 127.0.01 is typically used for the loopback address.
