LAB 04 - CONFIGURE IPV4 STATIC ADDRESSING

We statically assign ip addresses in Windows.

To do that:
Settings  -> Network Connections -> Ethhernet -> Change adapter options ->
right-click Ethernet -> Properties -> Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) ->
set the params


Here we change the subnet mask from 255.255.255.0/24 to 255.255.0.0/16.

Then we ping from both VMs proving that the change in the subnet mask
does not affect connectivity in this situation.

The reason why this works, is because 10.1.16.1 and 10.1.16.2 have matching
network IDs. This means that they are still on the same network.



To change the IP on Windows from the command-prompt:
>netsh interface ip set address "Ethernet" static 10.1.254.2 255.255.255.0 10.1.254.254


We have changed the address of one of the devices to 10.1.254.2 on a /24,
which is on a different network and subnet.

Now these devices need a router to communicate.



Now we change the subnet mask back to 255.255.0.0, but leave the address as
10.1.254.2:
>netsh interface ip set address "Ethernet" static 10.1.254.2 255.255.0.0 10.1.254.254


When we ping the other VM, it is successful now, because these devices are within the
same /16 subnet.



As we can see in these examples, misconfiguring subnet masks may or may not break
communication between devices. We must make sure the network and host portions
are respective of eachother when dealing with devices within the same network.
