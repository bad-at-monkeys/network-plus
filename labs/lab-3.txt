LAB 03 - CONFIGURE INTERFACE SETTINGS


We are going to train at layer1 and layer2 and configure
hubs and switches in gns3.

The gns3 labs are in the lab-03 directory.

HUBS

First we must configure the devices with IPs...

-> Go to pc1 console and ping pc2. Success.


-> ping pc3. It isn't conneted. Connect pc3.


-> Try to configure the hub. You can't, hubs don't configure.


-> Start a capture on pc3's link.


-> on pc1 ping pc3


-> go to wireshark to view the capture.
Check the layer2 destination address of the arp reply.

For a single ping on a hub, there are four packet exchanges.
Two for the arp broadcast/reply.
Two for the ICMP request/reply.


-> on pc1, ping pc2.

Remember, we are capturing from pc3. We can see the traffic between pc1 and pc2
because we are on a hub.

SWITCH

This is actually really time consuming because we have to re-configure every
new lab...just takke notes of lessons learnned.


Whenever we start a packet capture on pc3 with the managed switch, we see
broadcast packets only between pc2 and pc1. On the hub we saw all traffic
between the other nodes including the ICMPs.

When we ping pc3 from pc1 we see all traffic between those two nodes.

MANAGED SWITCH

Login to the switch then show all interfaces:
$ net show interface all

Then we can bring all the switch ports up at once:
$ net add interface swp1-6 mtu 1500
$ net pending
$ net commit

Confirm:
$ net show interface all


As of right now, there is no forwarding between ports so we must configure
a bridge between them:
$ net add bridge bridge ports swp1-4
$ net pending
$ net commit

$ net show interface all

Now these ports have been configured as access ports with the same logical
bridge. These ports are all in the same broadcast domain now.
