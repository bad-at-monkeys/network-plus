LAB 05 - ANALYZE ARP TRAFFIC

We are going to gather network configuration information using both Windows
Server and a Linux router. We are going to use Wireshark and ARP to analyze
network traffic.


In Server Manager we examine the properties of a local server link.

On the Windows Server, we also view the arp table.
We hhave entries for the network broadcast address and multicast addresses
used by thhe Windows network discovery protocol.


We can filter traffic in wireshark using booleans and strings:
arp or ip


When we start the linux router, we can see the traffic being generated in
Wireshark.


We can see the arp requests and replies everytime we start a device.



We login to the router and see that it has the IP 10.1.16.254:
$ arp -e
[get eth1]
$ ifconfig eth1
[display eth1 properties]


Now run tcpdump to list the interfaces on the local host:
$ tcpdump -D


We can start a packet capture on an interface with a filter:
$ tcpdump -i eth1 'ip'
