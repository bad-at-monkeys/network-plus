LAB 16 - CONFIGURE SYSLOG

We are going to configure a Linux VM as a syslog server. We then configure
a Linux server and router to forward their log files to the syslog server.

-----

$ sudo gedit /etc/rsyslog.conf


Uncomment the following two lines. These two lines enable the Ubuntu server's
rsyslog service to accept inbound connections.

module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="514")


The configuration is technically complete. However, all inbound log file entries
from all remote servers would be combined into a single log file. Such a log file
would be cumbersome to search. In the next section, you'll use a template to
separate inbound log file entries by hostname.

Go to the empty line after #### GLOBAL DIRECTIVES #### and enter the following
three lines:

$template DynamicFile,"/var/log/%HOSTNAME%.log"
*.* ?DynamicFile
& ~

-> The line $template DynamicFile,"/var/log/%HOSTNAME%.log" defines a template
format named DynamicFile that creates a log named for the server's hostname. In
this scenario, it will generate a log file named kali.log that originates from the
Kali Linux server.

-> The line *.* ?DynamicFile states that all Rsyslog facilities (services and
applications) of all severities (alert levels) will be sent via the template.

-> The line & ~ stops any process matching after this point.


:wq!

$ sudo systemctl restart rsyslog



Log in to the Kali vm:
