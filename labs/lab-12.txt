LAB 12 - ANALYZE A DHCP SERVER CONFIGURATION

This lab is a Windows Server one. If there are any commands that are useful,
I will list them. It takes too long to list all steps for Windows Server.

We create a DHCP scope in Windows Server Manager.

To install the DHCP server on Windows:
> Install-WindowsFeature DHCP -IncludeManagementTools


We configured MS10 and DC10 as failovers. Each taking 50% of the workload.


Questions:

1) How are client computers recognized when assigned a reserved IP address?

MAC address



2) Which of the following is an advantage of using a Reserved IP address
rather than a static IP address?

Reserved IP address configurations still receive other options from
the DHCP server, such as Router and DNS server



3) In what kind of environment might you use short DHCP lease duration?

Where clients enter and leave the network frequently
