LAB 09 - CONFIGURE DYNAMIC ROUTING

We configure RIP on some routers in gns3.

---
Router A
# set protocols rip interface eth1
# set protocols rip redistribute connected
# commit && save && exit
$ show ip rip



---
Router B
# set protocols rip interface eth0
# set protocols rip interface eth1
# set protocols rip redistribute connected
# commit && save && exit
$ show ip rip
$ show ip route

Router B has learned the route to A using RIP



---
Router C
# set protocols rip interface eth1
# set protocols rip redistribute connected
# commit && save && exit
$ show ip rip

Configure Redundant Path

Routers don't have a redundant path, if one link fails then half of the
network is unreachable.

Let's add a redundant link between A and C to avoid this.

We need to configure this redundant link on eth2 into a new 10.0.5.252/30
subnet:

Router A
# set interfaces ethernet eth2 address 10.0.5.254/30
# set protocols rip interface eth2
# commit && save && exit
$ sh ip route

Router C
# set interfaces ethernet eth2 address 10.0.5.253/30
# set protocols rip interface eth2
# commit && save && exit

We can see that our redundant link is preferred because it uses less hops.
