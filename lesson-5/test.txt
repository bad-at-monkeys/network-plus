LESSON 5 TEST - EXPLAINING IPV4 ADDRESSING

---
BOOK 5A

1) Convert the binary value 11110010 to decimal.

242



2) Convert 72 into binary.

01001000



3) What is the dotted decimal representation of an 8-bit netmask?

255.0.0.0



4) What is the dotted decimal representation of an 18-bit netmask?

255.255.192.0



5) Given an 18-bit netmask, are the IP addresses 172.16.1.10 and
172.16.54.10 on the same network?

Yes. If we convert the IP to binary, we see that the first 18 binary digits in
each address are the same

101011000001111000



6) If the network ID is 10.1.0.0/22, how many IP addresses are available for
allocation to host interfaces?

1022

BOOK 5B

1) Given the subnet mask 255.255.255.128, are the IP addresses 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.1.1 on the
same network?

No. The third octet for each is within the network portion, but different for
each IP address. The subnet mask contains 25 bits, but the 24thh bit is
different for each address.



2) If a packet is addressed to a remote network, what destination MAC
address will the sending node use to encapsulate the IP packet in a
frame?

The default gateway's.



3) Assuming unmanaged switches, how many broadcast domains are
present in the following figure?

4. A hub and 2 switches plus one for the routers.



4) If a host is configured with the IP address 10.0.10.22 and mask
255.255.255.192, what is the broadcast address of the subnet?

10.0.10.63

Convert the IP to binary:
  -> 10.1.10.22 = 00001010 00000000 00001010 00010110

Then work out the number of bits in the mask - 26.

Change the remaining host host bits in the host IP to 1s and
when you convert back to dotted decimal it should convert to 63.



5) What type of addressing delivers a packet to a single host from a group
without using unicast?

Anycast





---
BOOK 5C

1) True or False? The IP address 172.24.0.1 is routable over the Internet.

False.



2) What is a Class D address?

Multicasting.



3) What is the significance of 127.0.0.1?

Loopback.



4) A host is configured with the IP address 10.0.10.22 and subnet mask
255.255.255.192. How many hosts per subnet would this addressing
scheme support?

/18 supports 16,382 hosts per subnet.



5) If the IP address 10.0.10.22 were used with an /18 mask, how many
subnets and hosts per subnet would be available?

511 subnets
16,382  hosts per subnet

Design an IP Subnet

Ouur network ID is currently 198.51.100.0/24. We need to divide this in half
to accomodate hosts on two different floors, which is served by managed
switches. The whole network is served by a single router.

1) To divide the network in half, what subnet mask do you need to use?

A /25, 255.255.255.128.
Adding a single bit to the mask creates two subnets. The mask and the prefix
will be 255.255.255.128(/25).



2) What are the subnet IDs for each network?

198.51.100.0/25 and 198.51.100.128/25
An easy way to find the first subnet ID is to deduct the least significant
octet in the mask from 256, giving 128.



3) What is the broadcast address for each subnet? 198.52.100.127 and
198.51.100.255.

198.52.100.126
198.51.100.254



4) What is the range of assignable IP addresses for each subnet?

198.51.100.1-126
198.51.100.129-254
If we have each subnet ID and broadcast ID, the host ranges are simply the
values in between.



5) Your manager has considered his original plan and realized that it
does not accommodate the need for a WAN link to the head office or a
separate segment for a team that works with sensitive data. What mask
will you need to accommodate this new requirement, and how many
hosts per subnet will it allow?

We need four subnets now. A 255.255.255.240(/28) prefix/mask.
There will onlyy be 14 hosts per subnet though.
