LESSON 12 TESTS - ENSURING NETWORK AVAILABILITY

12A BOOK

1) True or false? SSH must be configured with two key pairs to operate; one
on the server and one on the client.

False. The server only must be configured with a key pair, the client can
optionally use a key pair to authenticate.



2) What remote management service is associated with TCP port 23?

Telnet.



3) Which port is used by the Network Time Protocol (NTP)?

UDP/123



4) What is SNTP?

Simple Network Time Protocol. A simpler NTP enabling clients workstations to
obtain the correct time from time servers.

12B BOOK

1) You have a plan for monitoring switches and routers that accommodates
network metrics (bandwidth, latency, and jitter) plus chassis
temperature and intrusion. What other performance metric should be
monitored?

CPU and memory resource utilization. We can also monitor storage...



2) How does an SNMP agent report an event to the management system?

TRAP methods with conditions defined by the admin. Once a condition is met
the agent traps the alert and notifies the admin.



3) What sort of log would you inspect if you wanted to track web server
access attempts?

Audit/Security/Access logs.



4) A technician has recommended changing the syslog logging level from
its current value of 3 to 6. Will this cause more or fewer events to be
forwarded?

More. Increasing to 6 will include alert levels 1-5 but disclude 7.



5) What would be the purpose of configuring thresholds in network
monitoring software?

So that alerts can be triggered once a threshold has been reached.

12C BOOK

1) How is jitter mitigated by a VoIP application?

Buffering packets.



2) How many different traffic classes can be defined by 802.1Q/p?

8 classes can be derived from the 3-bit value.



3) How does a traffic shaper benefit real-time data applications?

Traffic shapers can reserve bandwidth so that QoS params (latency and jitter),
for a real-time data application can be guaranteed.



4) What is a top listener in terms of network monitoring?

Top listeners are the interfaces that are receiving the most data packets.



5) You suspect that a network application is generating faulty packets.
What interface metric(s) might help you to diagnose the problem?

Error rates, discards/drops, re-Tx.

12 ONLINE

1) A server is using its host key to establish a secure channel for clients to
authenticate to the secure shell (SSH) server. Which of the following methods
can establish the channel? (Select all that apply.)

Username/password
Public key authentication
Kerberos



2) An organization is using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for
remote management and monitoring of servers and network appliances and must
deploy an agent to each device. Where are the statistics relating to the
activity of each device kept?

MIB or Management Information Base, duh.



3) A Windows administrator needs to perform administrative tasks on servers at
a different location and prefers to use a graphical user interface. What is the
best tool for the administrator to use?

RDP. All the other choices have a CLI.



4) A file server on the network is receiving synchronized time so that it can
communicate properly, however it cannot provide synchronized time for other
devices on the network. Why is this?

SNTP is simple and designed for end nodes, not for providing nodes with time.



5) An organization is designing a new data center. What types of environmental
issues should the organization implement sensors for? (Select all that apply.)

Temperature
Humidity
Electrical



6) An administrator received a Syslog alert, code 2. What level does this
indicate the issue is?

This is a Critical alert. The scale is 1-7, the higher the code,
the less severe.



7) An organization has ten employees in the finance department that all use
the accounting system for different purposes. An administrator is reviewing
logs and has discovered that all of the finance employees are using the same
login to access the accounting system. Which log was the administrator reviewing?

Audit Log. This records authentication and authorization privelages.



8) An administrator is monitoring the performance metrics for a server and
notices that the system memory utilization is very high. What does this indicate?

The syystem needs a memory upgrade.



9) An administrator needs to access servers using a key pair. What command can
the administrator use to create the key pair?

ssh-keygen



10) An administrator has blocked access to port 23 to prevent users from using
an unsecure terminal emulation software and protocol. What is the administrator
blocking the use of?

telnet
