SUMMARIZE ETHERNET STANDARDS

Network Data Transmission

All network signaling uses electromagnetic radiation (electric current, infrared,
or radio waves).

The electromagnetism creates a carrier wavelength with a given wavelength or
range of frequencies and is propelled through space by modulation and
encoding schemes.

Signals can be encoded as bits(1s and 0s) by transitioning between low and
high voltages (manipulating the amplitude of the signal).



Copper Cable

Copper cabling suffers from high attenuation (losing signal over distances).

Two types of copper cabling:
  -> Twisted pair
  -> Coax



Fiber Optic

Carries very high freq radiation in the infrared light portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Light signals are not affected by interference
or noise from other sources. Attenuation is lower in fiber as well.

Fiber optic supports more bandwidth over longer distances than copper.

Fiber optic cabling come in two types:
  -> Single-mode (SMF)
  -> Multi-mode (MMF) (OM1 OM2 OM3 OM4)





---
Ethernet Standards

IEEE 802.3 (ieee802.org/3) are the most important protocols, standards, and
products describing ethernet standards.

These standards specify the bit rate that should be achieved over different
types of media up to the supported distance limitations.

These ethernet media specs are named with a 3-part convention, xBASE-y.
This describes:
  -> The bit rate in Mbps or Gbps.
  -> Signal mode (baseband/broadband). All mainstream types of internet use
     baseband transmissions, so we will only see xBASE-y naming conventions.
  -> A designator for the media type.

10BASE-T = 10Mbps BASEband - twisted pair (-T)





---
Media Access Control and Collision Domains

Multiple Access Area Network - the available communications capacity is shared
                               between the nodes that are connected to the same
			       media.

Media Access Control (MAC) - the methods a network technology uses to determine
                             when nodes can communicate on shared media and
			     deal with possible problems.


Ethernet uses a contention-based MAC system.

Each network node connected to the same media is in the same collision domain.
When two nodes transmit at the same time, the signals collide and the signal
is dropped. This means they must be resent, reducing available bandwidth.

These collisions increase as nodes and traffic do and the data rate is reduced.



Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)

The Ethernet protocol governing contention and media access.

A collision is a state when a signal is present of the interface's
transmit and receive lines simultaneously.

On collision detection, the node broadcasts a jam signal. Each node that was
attempting to use the media then waits for a random period(backoff) before
attempting to retransmit.

The collision detection mechanism means that only half-duplex transmission is
possible (tx or rx, but not both).





---
100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet Standard

Fe still uses CSMA/CD, but with higher frequency signaling and improved coding
methods. 100BASE-TX refers to Fast Ethernet working over Cat5+ twisted-pair
copper cable with a max suppoty link length of 100m(328ft).


Typically 100BASE-TX is used with switches as the connection point for nodes.
Unlike a hub, eacdh switch port is on its own collision domain eliminating
contention between hosts.

Switches allow for full-duplex transmissions, where a node can tx/rx
at the same time. Therefore each node is on seperate media and has full access
to the 100Mbps cable bandwitdth.

Fe is backwards compatible with 10BASE-T hosts by using a autonegotiation
protocol allowing a host to choose the highest supported connection rate
(half or full/10 or 100Mbps). 10BASE-T specifies that a node should transmit
regular electric pulses while not transmitting to confirm link integrity.

Fe codes a 16-bit data packet called a Fast Link Pulseinto the 10BASE-T pulse
to advertise its service capabilities.





---
Gigabit Ethernet Standards 1000BASE-T 40GBASE-T

1000BASE-T  -  Cat5e+  -  Hubs not supported  -  100m(328ft)

10GBASE-T  -  UTP(Cat6)     -  55m(180ft)
              F/UTP(Cat6A)     100m(328ft)
	      S/FTP(Cat7)      100m(328ft)

40GBASE-T  - S/FTP (Cat8)  - 30m(100ft)

SUMMARIZE COPPER CABLING TYPES

Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable Considerations

A pair of twisted copper cables produce a balanced pair. The pair carries
the same signal with different polarities, one wire positive, one negative.
The receiver can distinguish a signal from any noise more strongly in this way.

The pair is twisted at different rates to prevent crosstalk.
Crosstalk is interference in signals due to proximity.

Solid core cables run straight along structures.
Standed core cables are flexible and can be manipulated and bent.

Most networks use UTP.



---
Shielded and Screened Twisted Pair Cable Considerations

Shielded cable is resiliant against interference like crosstalk.

STP types:
  -> Screened Cable: - thin outer foil shield around all pairs
                     - designated ScTP, F/UTP, or FTP
  -> Fully Shielded: - Braided outer screen and foil shielded pairs
                     - designated S/FTP or F/FTP

Using screened or shielded cables means using shielded connectors as well.





---
Cat Cable Standards

See chart in the Lesson 2 directory.

Details about the categories used for network media:
  -> Cat5 cable isn't available anymore.
  -> Cat6 can support 10Gbps over distances less than 55m.
  -> Cat6A gets 10Gbps at 100m, but is recommeded for installations
     in healthcare facilities, PoE 802.3bt applications, and for
     horizontal connections to WAPs.
  -> Cat7 terminates with GG45 or TERA connectors.
  -> Cat8 is intended to be used in data centers for top-of-rack
     connections between adjacent appliances.





---
Twisted Pair Connector Types

Registered Jack(RJ) connectors are used for the physical interface
on twisted pair cabling.


RJ-45
  -> Used with 4-pair(8wire) cables.
  -> 8P8C; 8 position 8 contacts.
  -> Used for Ethernet twisted pair cabling.


RJ-11
  -> 2-pair or 3-pair UTP.
  -> Room for 6, but the 4 center wires are mostly used.
  -> Inner pins(3,4) carry dial tone and voice circuit.
  -> Other pair is typically unused, but can be.
  -> 6P2C; 6 position 2 contacts.
  -> Can be converted to RJ-14(6P4C) or RJ-25(6P6C)
  -> Used for telephone systems.

4      Blue              Blue                            BixB-
5      Blue/White        Blue/White                      BixC+

8      Brown             Brown                           BixD-


Each pair is assigned a color (Blue, Green, Orange, Brown).

T568B is more widely deployed.
T568A is mandated by the government and residential cabling standard.

Plenum and Riser-rated Cable

Considerations inculde:
  -> UTP vs STP
  -> solid vs stranded core
  -> building regulations


A plenum space is a void in a building designed to carry heating, ventilation
and air conditioning(HVAC).

Plenum spaces are usually false ceilings or a raised floor.

Plenum spaces are vulnerable to fires, so the cabling must meet regulations:
  -> fire-retardant cabling
  -> self-extinguishing
  -> smokeless when burned
  -> etc


Plenum cable is typically marked as CMP/MMP.


Non-plenum cables are treated and can be less flexible.
This cables runs through PVC jackets.
Non-plenum, general purpose cables are marked CMG/MMG or CM/MP.


Cabling that passes between two floor is called riser cabling.
The conduits must be fire-stopped.





---
Coaxial and Twinaxial Cable and Connectors

Coax is made of two conductors that share the same axis("co" "ax").

The core conductor is solid or stranded wire enclosed by plastic, foil,
then wire-mesh the second conductor (shield/ground), and finally a plastic
sheath layer protects everything.


Coax is often usesd for cable TV and is terminated using F-type connectors.


Twinaxial cable contains two inner connectors.

Twinax is used in datacenter 10GbE(10BASE-CR) and 40GBASE-CR4 interconnects
of up to about 5m for passive cable types and 10m for active cable types.

Twinax for 10/40GbE is terminated using SFP+ DAC and QSFP+ DAC tranceivers.





##########
SUMMARIZE FIBER OPTIC CABLING TYPES


---
Fiber Optic Cabling Considertations

Fiber uses infrared light, which make it resilient against interference,
interception, and attenuation.

As a result, fiber supports higher bandwidth and longer distances than copper.


A single optical fiber is constructed with three elements:
  -> Core; provides the transmission path(waveguide) for light signals.
  -> Cladding; reflects signals into the waveguide, made from glass or
     plastic. This is effectively a boundary for the waveguide.
  -> Buffer; protective plastic coating.


Basic operation allows a single fiber strand to transfer light in a single
direction at a time. Therefore, multiple fibers are oftern bundled within a
cable to allow for simultaneous transmission and reception.





---
SMF and MMF

Fiber is classified by:
  -> Mode
  -> Composition(glass/plastic)
  -> Core/cladding size

i.e. 8.3 micron core/125 microcladding single-mode glass


SMF:
  -> Small core 8-10microns
  -> Long wavelength, near infrared (1310nm or 1550nm)
  -> Up to 100Gbps over many km
  -> OS1 - indoor
  -> OS2 - outdoor


MMF:
  -> Large core 62.5 or 50microns
  -> Short wavelength, light (850nm or 1300nm) in multiple waves
     varying in length
  -> Less expensive optics, less expensive to deploy
  -> More suited for LANs than WANs



MMF is graded by Optical Multimode(OM) categories:
  -> OM1/OM2; 62.5micron cable is OM1, early 50micron cable is OM2,
     rated for applications up to 1Gbps using LED transmitters.
  -> OM3/OM4; also 50micron but constructed differently. Designed
     for use with Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers(VCSEL),
     also known as Laser Optimized MMF(LOMMF). Not as powerful as
     the solid-state lasers in SMF, but supports higher modulation.

NOTE: Modulation means higher light pulse transmission.

Fiber Optic Connector Types

Straight Tip(ST):
  -> Early bayonet-type connector.
  -> Uses push/twist locking connector.
  -> Not used often for Ethernet deployment.


Subscriber Connector(SC):
  -> Push/pull locking connector.
  -> Used for SMF and MMF.
  -> Common for Gigabit Ethernet deployment.


Local Connector(LC):
  -> Small form-factor.
  -> Tabbed push/pull locking mechanism.
  -> Higher port density.
  -> Widley adopted for Gigabit Ethernet and 10/40GbE


Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack(MTRJ):
  -> Small form-factor.
  -> Duplex connector with snap-in locking mechanism.
  -> Used for MMF.

Fiber is often used for backbone cabling in office networks and for
workstations with high-bandwidth requirements, like video editing.

The principal applications for 10GbE or better are:
  -> Increased bandwidth between server connections in datacenters.
  -> Storage Area Networks(SANs)
  -> Replacing existing switched public data networks based on
     legacy proprietary technologies with simpler Ethernet switches.





---
Fiber Optic Cable Installation

Fiber can be installed in the same topology as copper using distribution
frames and switches.

Long distance cables are laid as trunks or rings with repeaters or amplifiers
between cable segments.



Fiber Optic Patch Cords:
  -> Fiber patch cables come in same connecto(LC-LC) or mixed (LC-SC).
  -> Duplex patch cords must have the Tx port on the transmitter linked
     to the Rx port on the receiver.
  -> TIA/EIA standard sets A to B patch cord to port orientations.
  -> Each element in the link must preform a crossover, and there must be
     an odd number of elements (2 patch cords and 1 permanent link).

Roughly, a patched fiber cable looks like:

             A   B _  _ A         B _  _ A
        Rx<=|<====|_||_|<==========|_||_|<====|<=Tx
TRANCEIVER  |      _  _             _  _      | TRANCEIVER
        Tx->|---->|_||_|---------->|_||_|---->|-> Rx
	     B   A     B           A     B
	     PATCH       PERMANENT       PATCH
	     CORD          LINK          CORD

Most connectors are keyed, preventing incorrect insertion. But an optical
power meter can be used to determine whether an optical signal is being
received.



Finishing Type
The fiber optic core is a ceramic/plastic ferrule that holds the glass strand.
The tip of the ferrule can be finished in one of three formats:
  -> Physical Contact(PC); the faces of the connector and fiber tip are
     polished so that they fit together better, reducing return loss.
  -> Ultra Physical Contact(UPC); polished to a higher standard.
  -> Angled Physical Contact(APC); faces are angled for the tightest
     posible connection and better return loss performance. This is
     typically used for cable carrying analog signalling and to
     implement long distance transmissions on Passive Optical Networks.

It is important to match the finishing type.

APC finishing is often not supported by patch panels, tranceivers, and
switchports designed for Ethernet.


For multiple strands in a single cable they are color coded:

TYPE          JACKET COLOR    CONNECTOR COLOR
OM1           orange          beige
OM2           orange          black
OM3/OM4       aqua            aqua
SMF PC/UPC    yellow          blue
SMF APC       yellow          green

DEPLOY ETHERNET CABLING

Structured Cabling System

ANSI/TIA/EIA 568 identifies the following subsystems within a
structured cabling system:
  -> Work Area; typically a wall port where the users are.
  -> Horizontal; connects work areas to the nearest cross-connect
     or distribution frame.
  -> Backbone; connects horizontal cross-connects(HCCs) to the main
     vertical cross connect.
  -> Telecommunications Room; houses horizontal cross-connects acting
     as a termination point for horizontal cabling along with a
     connection to the backbone cabling. Equipment rooms are an intermediary
     for the telecom room.
  -> Demarc; marking the point at which the external cabling is joined with
     the internal cabling. This is where the providers network terminates
     and the organizations network begins.





---
Cable Management

Copper wiring is terminated using a distribution frame or a punchdown block.

A punchdown block consists of a bunch of insulation-displacement
connection(IDC) terminals.

66 Block:
  -> Terminates telephone cabling and legacy systems.
  -> 50 rows of 4 IDC terminals.
  -> The 25-pair provider cable is terminated on one side.
  -> The other side terminates the PBX wiring.
  -> A jumper is installed over the middle two terminals completing the
     connection.


110 Block:
  -> Supports 100MHz(Cat5) and better.
  -> Arranged horizontally.
  -> Incoming wires are fed into channels on the block and terminated with
     a connector block.
  -> Outgoing wires are then punched into the terminals of
     the connector blocks.


Patch Panel:
  -> Simplifies numerous moves, adds, and changes(MACs).
  -> Has a patch panel with IDCs on one side and pre-terminated RJ-45
     modular ports on the other.
  -> The structured cabling is terminated on the back of a patch panel
     on the IDCs.
  -> RJ-45 patch cords are used to connect the port to another port.
  -> The most common wiring distribution system.





---
Termination Tools

Punchdown tool:
  -> Terminates fixed cable
  -> Requires different blades for different IDC formats.

Block tool:
  -> Terminates a group of connectors.
  -> For a 110-block, there are four position blocks (terminates 4-pair data
     cabling) and five position blocks (terminates 25-pair telephony cable).

Cable crimper:
  -> Creates patch cords.
  -> Fixes a connector to a cable.


For shielded and screened cable, termination must have shielded IDCs or modular
plugs.





---
Fiber Distribution Panels and Fusion Splicing

Permanent cables run through conduit to wall ports at the client access end.
A fiber distribution panel at the switch end.

Fiber patch cables complete the link from the wall to the NIC and from the
patch panel to the switchport.

Connectors "cost" a certain amount of insertion loss.

An adhesive junction box can splice fiber, or a more permanent join can be
done with a fusion splicer.





---
Tranceivers

Modern enterprise switches and routers are available with modular, hot-
swappable tranceivers/media converters to connect multiple types of cabling.

This started with the GBIC form factor, but that's been replaced with SFP.


SFP/SFP+
  -> Uses LC connectors designed for GbE.
  -> SFP+ supports 10GbE on the LC connector.
  -> Tranceivers designed to support a specific wavelength,
     and be installed as matching pairs.


QSFP/QSFP+
  -> Supports 4x1Gbps, aggregated into a 4Gbps channel.
  -> QSFP+ supports 4x10Gbps links aggregated into a 40Gbps channel.
  -> Can be used with Wavelength Division Multiplexing(WDM) Ethernet





---
Wavelength Division Multiplexing

WDM is a means of using a strand to Tx/Rx more than one channel at a time.


Bidirectional Wavelength Division Multiplexing(BiDi WDM)
  -> Support Tx/Rx over the same strand of fiber.
  -> Uses WDM to transmit Tx/Rx signals over slightly different wavelengths.
  -> Must be installed in opposite pairs.


Coarse and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
  -> CWDM supports 16 wavelengths, deploys 4 or 8 bidirectional channels
     over a single fiber strand.
  -> Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing(DWDM) provisions larger
     numbers of channels (10,40,80,160). Expensive.
  -> Both support multi-channel 1G, 10G, 40G Ethernet links.
  -> Transceivers must be installed in opposite pairs for each channel.
