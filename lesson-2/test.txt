LESSON 2 - DEPLOYING ETHERNET CABLING

1) With CSMA/CD, what will happen if a host has data to transmit and there
   is already data on the cable?

A jam message is sent to all hosts on the network, the hosts then standoff
transmission until the data is transmitted.

   cable?

100BASE-TX



3) Which copper Ethernet standard meets the bandwidth requirements for
   clients in an office network while minimizing costs?

1000BASE-T or Gigabit Ethernet



4) A network designer wants to run a 10 gigabit backbone between two
   switches in buildings that are 75 m (246 feet) apart. What is the main
   consideration when selecting an appropriate copper cable?

Distance. Some type of shielded or screened cat6A or better is required
for the installation to be compliant with Ethernet standard 10GBASE-T.



5) What is the measurement standard for wire thickness?

   faster than 100 Mbps?

Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6A, Cat7(screened/shielded), Cat8(screened/shielded)

False. Cat standards also describe connectors and modules.



9) 100BASE-T transmit pins are 1 and 2. What color code are the wires
   terminated to these pins under T568A and T568B?

T568A = Green/White and Green
T568B = Oange/White and Orange



10) Why is plenum-rated cable used when cable is run in an area where
    building air is circulated?

Plenum-rated cable is safe for areas prone to fire because it adheres
to those safety standards.



11) Which cable type consists of a single core made of solid copper
    surrounded by insulation, a braided metal shielding, and an outer cover?

13) Which grade or grades of fiber have a 62.5 micron core?

OM1



14) Which fiber Ethernet standard is best suited to implementing backbone
    cabling that does not exceed 200 m (656 feet) and can achieve at least
    4 Gbps throughput?

10GBASE-SR



15) What maximum distance is defined in standards documentation for
    1000BASE-LX running over MMF?

550m



16) You need to provision a fiber patch panel to terminate incoming cabling
    with green LC connectors. What type of ports should be provisioned on
    the patch panel?

SMF APC; the patch panel must be provisioned with Lucent Connector ports
with APC finishing type.



17) Which types of distribution frame are best suited to 100 MHz or better
    operation?

110-block, BIX, Krone.



18) What type of distribution frame is best suited to cabling wall ports to
    Ethernet switches in way that best supports futures changes?

Patch panel



19) What tool is used to terminate wiring at a 110 block?

Punchdown tool



20) At what layer of the OSI model does a fiber distribution panel work?

All distribution frames operate at Layer1.



21) You need to provision modular SFP+ transceivers to support a 10 gigabit
    link between two switches using an existing fiber cable. What two
    characteristics must you check when ordering the transceivers?

The specific wavelength and Ethernet standard.
The type of connecting interface.



22) You have selected an SFP+ 1310 nm Tx and 1490 nm Rx transceiver to
    implement a BiDi link between two switches. Should you provision a
    second SFP+ 1310 nm Tx and 1490 nm Rx for the other switch?

No, we need an SFP+ module with 1490nm Tx and 1310nm Rx.
