LESSON 9 TESTS - EXPLAINING TRANSPORT LAYER PROTOCOLS


---
BOOK 9A

1) How many port numbers are required to establish a connection at the
Transport layer?

2. A server port and a client port.



2) What is the purpose of the window field in a TCP segment?

This is the amount of data a host can receive before sending an ACK. This is
used for flow control.



3) What are the sizes of TCP and UDP headers?

TCP = 20+bytes
UDP = 8bytes



4) True or False? User Datagram Protocol (UDP), like TCP, uses flow control
in the sending of data packets.

False. UDP uses no flow control. The application implements these features.



5) What port and protocol does TFTP use at the Transport layer?

UDP/69

BOOK 9B

1) What type of scanning tool outputs a “Host is up” status report.

IP scanner.



2) You are auditing the service configuration of a Linux server. Which
command can you use to check the PID associated with a TCP port, even
if there are no active connections?

netstat -patn
ss -patn



3) A technician has identified an undocumented host using an IP address
in a range set aside as unallocated. The technician is going to run a
fingerprinting scan. What type of information could this yield about the
host?

Software versioning/naming, OS info, hardware.



4) You need to analyze the information saved in a .pcap file. What type of
command-line tool or other utility is best suited to this task?

tcpdump or wireshark.

ONLINE 9

1) A server administrator is analyzing a normal Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) Teardown connection to their servers. How many FIN-WAIT states does the
client go through during this process?

Two. The client sends a FIN segment to the server and enters the FIN-WAIT
state.



2) A security analyst is looking at traffic from older devices between ports
2,000 - 3,000. What is this traffic most likely?

Clent ports. 1024-5000 is typically client ports on legacy systems.
Ports 0-1023 are IANA assigned.
49152-65535 are for private/dynamic use.



3) A penetration tester wants to perform remote port scanning. Which Nmap scan
fast technique as the scanning host requests a connection without acknowledging
it?

-sS. This is a half-open scan that requests a connection without
acknowledging it. The target's response to the scan's SYN packet identifies
the port state.



4) A security analyst is reviewing UDP traffic headers. Which of the following
is NOT a field in a UDP traffic header?

Window. This is a field in a TCP header.



5) A network administrator is looking at packet captures from the network and
trying to isolate email traffic. Which of the following should the network
administrator include? (Select all that apply.)

TCP/25 - SMTP
TCP/143 - IMAP



6) A security analyst wants to reconstruct the packet contents for a
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) session in Wireshark. Which function
should the security analyst use?

Follow TCP Stream. This option allows us to reconstruct the packet
contents for a TCP session.



7) A penetration tester has performed a quick service enumeration with
Nmap and now wants to further enumerate the findings. Which parameter should
the pen tester use in the command?

-sV. This option helps us find the versioning of software at the port.



8) A systems engineer is looking at running services on the company's
Linux hosts and wants to include ports in the listening state in the output.
Which netstat switch should the engineer use?

-a. This includes ports in the listening state.



9) A security engineer is looking at Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
traffic headers. Which of the following allows the receiver to rebuild the
message correctly?

Sequence number. This helps us rebuild and reorder packets.



10) A systems administrator is trying to get a basic inventory of what is
on the network. Which of the following is a tool which will allow the
administrator to easily scan for IPs?

PRTG is an IP scanner.
