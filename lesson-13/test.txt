LESSON 13 TESTS - EXPALINING COMMON SECURITY CONCEPTS

---
13A BOOK

1) What type of assessment is most likely to measure security policies and
controls against a standard framework?

Posture/Risk assessment



2) True or false? An automated vulnerability scanner can be used to detect
zero-days.

False. Zero-days aren't officially known to the public, therefore they couldn't
be in a CVE database.



3) What type of assessment tool is configured with details of CVEs?

An automated vulnerability scanner.



4) 515web IT staff discovered an entry when reviewing their audit logs
showing that a junior employee from the sales department had logged
into the network at 3:00 a.m. Further review of the audit logs show that
he had changed his timecard on the HR server. Which security factor
was breached, and did the attack exploit a software vulnerability or a
configuration vulnerability?

This was an internal configuration vulnerability/exploitation that compromised
the integrity of data stored in the network.



5) What type of security audit performs active testing of security controls?

Penetration testing.

BOOK 13B

1) What element is missing from the following list, and what is its purpose?
• Identification
• Authentification
• Accounting

Authorization. This assigns privelages over the network object to the subject.



2) What is the purpose of SSO?

Allows an entity to verify their identity through certificates so that they only
need to sign-in once.



3) True or false? A subject’s private key is embedded in the digital
certificate that represents its digital identity?

False. The private key is always for the owner only and cannot be shared with
anything.



4) What is a RADIUS client, and how should it be configured?

A thing that accepts user connections. The client must be configured with the
RADIUS server IP and possess the same shared secret.



5) Where would EAPoL be configured?

On a switch interface/port.

ONLINE

1) The amount of data traffic both sent and received or calculated as a
percentage of the available bandwidth is known as which interface
monitoring metric?

Utilization. This is the amount of data traffic both sent and received. It can
also be calculated as a percentage of the available bandwidth.



2) Which of the following processes of an identity and access management (IAM)
system proves that the user is who they say they are?Which of the following
processes of an identity and access management (IAM) system proves that the
user is who they say they are?

Authentication



3) An organization hired a security firm to hack into its systems in order to
determine what type of exploitable weaknesses the organization was vulnerable
to. What kind of testing is this?

Penetration testing. This is the authorized use of exploitation techniques to
discover weaknesses in a targets systems.



4) An organization hires a new Marketing department head from outside the
company. The new employee is surprised to learn that they cannot assign
permissions to the Marketing folders to employees that work in other areas
of the company. What kind of access management is the organization using?

Role-based access. This defines a set of organizational roles, then assigns the
appropriate users to them.



5) A security professional is working to identify all the ways a threat agent
can breach security. What security concept does the threat actor represent?

Threat. It's in the question, this person is a threat.



6) An employee logs into their computer when they arrive at work and, regardless
of what network resources they access throughout the day, they do not have to
log in to anything else. What type of authentication is this?

Single Sign-On (SSO). This allows a user to authenticate once for the duration
of some condition until they must sign-on again.



7) An administrator needs to perform maintenance on routers and switches and is
authenticating to them over TCP port 49. What protocol is the administrator
using?

TACACS+. Remember that this protocol is used to authenticate to routers and
switches. If we remember that, then we don't need to remember the port number.



8) An organization has identified that they must be able to continually process
customer payments and pay employee salaries to keep the business running even
in the event of a service disruption as mission essential functions. What kind
of assessment did the organization use to make these determinations?

Process Asessment. This question is asking about HOW a company is doing
something, which is a process.



9) An organization deployed components so that they could use NetFlow to measure
network traffic statistics. Which of the deployed components needs a high
bandwidth network link and substantial storage capacity?

NetFlow collector. These need a high-bandwisth network link and substantial
storage capacity. It aggregates flows from multiple exporters, so large networks
can generate massive amounts of records.



10) An organization is using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to
update the directory database. The administrator insists that steps to ensure
access to the directory has already been completed and is secure. What
authentication methods will the administrator disable? (Select all that apply.)

DISABLE - simple bind, no authentication. These are insecure.
ENABLE - SASL and LDAPS. These are secure.



11) A security company is working with a new customer and is describing
different kinds of attacks they have discovered through research. What form
of threat research does this represent?

Behavioral threat research. This is a narrative commentary describing examples
of attacks and the TTPs gathered through primary research sources.



12) A security administrator is studying the relationship between
vulnerabilities, threats, and risks. Which of the following is a true statement
regarding these categories?

A threat is a potential for an entity to breach security.



13) Network users are reporting issues with videos constantly buffering. What
kinds of issues should the administrator test for? (Select all that apply.)

Packet loss
Latenncy
Jitter



14) A sysadmin is looking into bandwidth management. Which kind of bandwidth
management technology uses a header field to indicate a priority value for a
layer 3 (IP) packet?

DiffServ. Differentiated Services classifies each packet passing through a
layer 3 device and can use defined router policies to use packet classification
to prioritize delivery.



15) An organization that issues public keys should obtain a digital
certificate. What does the digital certificate contain? (Select all that apply.)

Information on the certificate's guarantor.
Information about the subject.
The subject's public key.
