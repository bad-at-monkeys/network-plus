Design an IP Subnet

Ouur network ID is currently 198.51.100.0/24. We need to divide this in half
to accomodate hosts on two different floors, which is served by managed
switches. The whole network is served by a single router.

1) To divide the network in half, what subnet mask do you need to use?

A /25, 255.255.255.128.
Adding a single bit to the mask creates two subnets. The mask and the prefix
will be 255.255.255.128(/25).



2) What are the subnet IDs for each network?

198.51.100.0/25 and 198.51.100.128/25
An easy way to find the first subnet ID is to deduct the least significant
octet in the mask from 256, giving 128.



3) What is the broadcast address for each subnet? 198.52.100.127 and
198.51.100.255.

198.52.100.126
198.51.100.254



4) What is the range of assignable IP addresses for each subnet?

198.51.100.1-126
198.51.100.129-254
If we have each subnet ID and broadcast ID, the host ranges are simply the
values in between.

sent out for that device yet. We must ping the destination first to
create an ARP entry.



4) Output from a ping command reports some values in milliseconds. What
does this measure?

The round-trip request/reply process of the packet.



5) True or False? Receiving an echo reply message indicates that the link

is trying to ping 192.168.16.192. The network has been subnetted with
the custom mask 255.255.255.224. Why might this return a “Destination
host unreachable” message?

The IP address resolves to the subnet network address, not a host address.



4) Two client hosts have intermittent connectivity issues when accessing
a server service on another subnet. No other client hosts exhibit this
problem. What configuration problem might you suspect?

Duplicate IP/MAC addresses.



5) You have pinged the router for the local subnet and confirmed that there
is a valid link. The local host cannot access remote hosts, however. No
other users are experiencing problems. What do you think is the cause?

The router isn't configured as the default gateway for the local host.
We can ping it, but the host isn't using it for routing.



6) A Windows client workstation cannot access a help desk application
server by its name support.515support.com. The service can be accessed

Host C: IP: 192.168.1.21, Mask: 255.255.0.0
Host D: IP: 192.168.0.10, Mask: 255.255.255.0

Host D will not be able to communicate with the others. Host C cannot contact
Host D, as it thinks Host D is on the same local network. Host C needs to route
messages for 192.168.0.0/24 via the default gateway.



13) A helpdesk technician is setting up a new IP configuration for a new
Ethernet adapter on a client using PowerShell. Which command should
the technician use?

Book - 7A

1) What is a directly connected route?

Routers that are physcially connected to another at the port.



2) Which of the parameters in the following routing table entry represents
the gateway?

R 192.168.1.0/24 [120/1] via 198.51.100.254, GigabitEthernet0/1

198.51.100.254.
The destination network is 192.168.1.0/24



3) What type of routing table entry is shown?

S* 0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 192.0.2.1

Statically configured default route.



4) True or False? A router will not forward a packet when the TTL field is 0.

True. When the TTL field is 0, the packet is dropped off the network.

BOOK 7B

1) Which factors are used by default in EIGRP to identify the least-cost path?

Delay and bandwidth.



2) What is an ASN and how does it assist route aggregation?

A number issued by the IANA that represents an Autonomous System.
It represents a complex private network as a simple number.
It is used by BGP to identify networks accross the internet.



3) Of the routing protocols listed in the CompTIA Network+ syllabus, which
has the highest default value AD and does that make it more or less
trusted than other protocols?

Static routing has the lowest. RIP has the highest, making it less trusted
than the other protocols.



4) An IP network comprises hundreds of subnets deployed to offices in
multiple geographical locations. Of the routing protocols listed in the
CompTIA Network+ syllabus, which is best suited to this scale of network
and why?

OSPF. The hierarchical design means that the network can be divided into
areas representing different sites, reduce the size of routing tables, and
ensure fast convergence.

EIGRP can also be used.



5) A company has eight networks, using the subnet addresses 192.168.0.0/24,
192.168.1.0/24 … 192.168.7.0/24. What network prefix and subnet mask can
be used to summarize a supernet route to these networks?

192.168.1.0/21

It takes 3-bits to summaraze 8 networks (2^3=8). Subtracting 3-bits from the
network mask makes the supernet network prefix /21. The third octet of the
mask will use 5-bits, which is 248 in decimal - 255.255.248.0.



6) True or false. VLSM means using more than one mask to subnet an IP
network.

True. Admins can precisely match subnet requirements by using different mask
sizes within a network.

2) Which is the largest subnet in the topology? What is the minimum
number of bits that will be needed for that number of hosts? How many
IP addresses will that subnet provide? What would be the VLSM and
address range for the largest subnet?

Branch A at 16,000 hosts.
14 bits are needed.
Provides 16,382 IPs (16384-2).
/18 will be the VLSM mask, giving an IP range of 172.30.0.1-172.30.63.254.



3) What is the next largest subnet in the design? How many host bits will be
needed for that subnet? How many IP addresses will that subnet provide
and what is the VLSM?

Branch B at 8,000 hosts.
13-bits are needed.
Provides 8,190 addresses.
/19 is the VLSM mask with a IP range of 172.30.64.1-172.30.95.245.



4) Work out the remaining subnets, remembering to ensure that subnet
ranges do not overlap, but equally that you do not waste IP addresses.
Complete the table.

BOOK 7C

1) A router must forward traffic received over a single physical interface
connected to a switch trunk port to the appropriate virtual LAN (VLAN).
What feature must be configured on the router?

Subinterfaces for each VLAN carried over the trunk. Each subinterface must be
configured with an IP address and a mask for the subnet mapped to the VLAN.



2) True or false? Layer 3 capable switches are interchangeable with routers.

False. They are interchangeable with internal routers, as they do not have
public interfaces and can only route between internal subnets.



3) True or false? Any occurrence of an asterisk in traceroute output
indicates that there is no connectivity the destination along that path.

False. Asterisks just mean that a router may not be responding to probes.



4) Your network monitor is recording high numbers of ICMP Time Exceeded
notifications. What type of routing issue does this typically indicate?

This is typical in a routing loop, where packets circulate between routers
until the TTL is exceeded.



5) A campus to datacenter fiber optic link has been laid over 15 km of single
mode fiber with one fusion splice along this run. The termination at each
end requires two connectors. You need to evaluate a proposal to use
10GBASE-LR transceiver modules for the router. The module specification
quotes Tx power of –8.2 dBm and Rx sensitivity of –14.4 dBm. Assuming
attenuation of 0.4 dB/km, 0.75 dB loss per connector, and 0.3 dB loss per
splice, do these modules work within the expected loss budget?

1 splice = 0.3
2 connectors = 1.5
0.4 x 15 = 6
total loss = 0.3 + 3.0 + 6 = 7.8dBm
allowed loss = 14.4 - 8.2 = 6.2dBm

No, the expected loss budget is 6.2dBm. The total loss is 7.8dBm.

7C - Design a Branch Office Internetwork

1) Given the current scenario of the charity, how would the routers at each
local office be configured?

Since the link is only used for web browsing and online main, we can configure
the local office routers with static routes/default gateway/gateway of last
resort to forward all traffic to the main site, which would forward the web
traffic on.



2) With this new infrastructure in place, what changes would need to be
made to the router’s configuration?

Additional routing table entries are necessary. This can be configured through
static routes or dynamic routing protocols. A dynamic protocol is better here
for network scaleability.



3) Which protocol would be best here?

RIPv2 can be used because of the networks simplicity and it is within the
16 hop count limit.



4) Considering the potential changes a successful pilot in the East region
might bring about in the whole organization, would your router
configuration options change?

Yes, we would probably need a more scaleable protocol. OSPF would work
best here because of the IP numbering differences including VLSM.



5) What might you do to manage the much larger number of IP subnets?

We could use OSPF areas to manage the large topology and route summarization
to reduce processing load.

secure. What does ICANN manage? (Select all that apply.)

Generic TLDs
DNS



2) A client is attempting to renew its lease with the DHCP server so that it
can keep the same IP addressing information. How much of the lease duration
has lapsed?

At least 50%. Clients can renew a lease when atleast half the lease period
has elapsed so that it may keep the same IP information.



3) A user has typed www.network.com into a web browser. The domain name server
cannot resolve the name, so it is querying other name servers to try to find
it. What kind of lookup is the domain name server performing?

Recursive. Recursive lookups mean that if the queried server is not
authoritative, it takes on the task of querying other name servers until
it finds the requested record or times out.



4) An administrator configures a new mail server to meet the organization's
goals. Which record lists the IP addresses or names of servers that can send
email from a particular domain and combats the sending of spam?

SPF. Sender Policy Framework records list the IP addresses or names of servers
that can send email from a particular domain and combats the sendign of spam.



5) An administrator is using DHCP and wants to retain centralized management
of IP addressing but needs to ensure that specific devices that supply
always-on functionality have static IP address assignments. What is the
best solution?

Create reservations. This is a mapping of a MAC to a specific IP within
the DHCP server address pool.



6) An administrator ran a command and determined that the FQDN of a client
is forbes.sales.realty.com. What is the hostname of the client?

forbes



7) An organization is using IPv4 addresses. Which of the following records

A. A records are for IPv4. AAAA records are for IPv6.



8) An administrator is configuring the TCP/IP settings in workstations and
wants to use the solution with the least amount of overhead. What setting
will the administrator select?

DHCP. This automatically assigns IPs to end systems, minimizing overhead.
Static addressing increases the operating expense (overhead) of the network
because the administrator needs to invest more time in configuration, which
costs more money at the end of the day.



9) An administrator is configuring a DHCP server. What configurations must
the administrator apply to the server? (Select all that apply.)

The server must receive a static IP.
The admin must configure a scope.

DHCP is an "always on" service. Static IPs should be assigned to these types.

that the DHCP server issues to clients.



10) An organization has multiple subnets but is only using one DHCP server.
How is this possible? (Select all that apply.)

DHCP relay.
UDP forwarding.

DHCP relay agents provide forwarding of DHCP traffic between subnnets.
UDP forwarding is more general but includes DHCP, NTP, and other
broadcast based services.

of some condition until they must sign-on again.



7) An administrator needs to perform maintenance on routers and switches and is
authenticating to them over TCP port 49. What protocol is the administrator
using?

TACACS+. Remember that this protocol is used to authenticate to routers and
switches. If we remember that, then we don't need to remember the port number.



8) An organization has identified that they must be able to continually process
customer payments and pay employee salaries to keep the business running even
in the event of a service disruption as mission essential functions. What kind
of assessment did the organization use to make these determinations?

---
BOOK 14B

1) You are planning to reconfigure static and DHCP-assigned IP addresses
across the network during scheduled downtime. What preliminary step
should you take to minimize connectivity issues when the network is
reopened?

Ensure that clients obtain a new DHCP lease by shortening the lease period in
advance or by using a script to force clients to renew the lease at strtup.



2) If a network adapter is using the address 169.254.1.10 on a host
connected to the LAN, what would you suspect?

That the DHCP server is down, this is an APIPA address.



3) Following maintenance on network switches, users in one department
cannot access the companyʼs internal web and email servers. You can
demonstrate basic connectivity between the hosts and the servers by IP
address. What might the problem be?

This is a name resolution problem. Because the admin can ping by IP but not
otherwise indicates that users lost access to the DNS server from a VLAN
configuration.



4) You are troubleshooting a connectivity problem with a network
application server. Certain clients cannot connect to the service port.
How could you rule out a network or remote client host firewall as the
cause of the problem?

With no host firewall ruunning, scan or connect to the service port interface
with netcat or nmap.



SCENARIO (Page 337)

You are staffing the network help desk and dealing with support requests as they
arrive. Your network uses four access switches to support four subnets. One subnet
contains network servers (authentication, directory services, DNS, and DHCP) and
another contains Line of Business (LoB) application servers, for sales and order
processing. There are two client subnets, serving different floors in the building.

1) You receive a call from the user of host A who has always been able to
connect to the LoB application servers, but today she is unable to connect.
You verbally check with other users and discover that none of the hosts
on subnet 20 can connect, but that users in subnet 10 report no problems.
What tests should you perform to narrow down the cause of the problem?

Either the link to thhe router from subnet 20 has failed, or hosts in subnet 20
are no longer receiving a correct IP configuration from the network servers. To
test, from any host in subnet 20 we should ping the loopback address and then ping
that hosts address. If these fail, or the host is using APIPA, investigate
communications with the network servers. If local IP config is good, ping the
router. If all else fails, check the switcth or cabling.



2) You send a junior technician to the equipment room to fix the problem.
Sometime later, another user from subnet 20 calls complaining that he
cannot connect to the Internet. What questions should you ask to begin
troubleshooting?

Ask if the user can connect to one of the LoB applications. If this fails, we can
check whether other users are experiencing the issue and establish scope.



3) You asked a junior technician to step in because your manager had
asked you to deploy a wireless access point on the network to support
a sales event due to start the next day. There will be lots of guests,
and your manager wants them all to have Internet access. You did not
have much time, so you simply added the access point to the switch
supporting subnet 10. The next day arrives, and sometime after the
sales event starts, multiple employees in subnet 10 report that when
they attempt to connect to the network, they get a message that the
Windows network has limited connectivity. What might be the cause and
what test should you use to confirm the issue?

The most likely cause is that guest devices have exhausted the DHCP address pool
for that scope. The question mentions "Windows", so we can confirm that this is
the issue if the clients within the subnet are receiving APIPA addresses. We
can verify this with ipconfig.

ONLINE

1) A user is attempting to access a government network, but the network will not
allow the user’s device to connect until the user updates the operating system.
What kind of defense mechanism is this?

Network Access Control (NAC). NAC authenticates endpoints at the point they
connect to the network, and can ensure clients are running an authorized OS and
have up to date patch and security configurations.



2) An administrator received an alert regarding suspicious activity on the
network. The system is logging the activity and the administrator must determine
how to handle the situation. What kind of system most likely sent the alert?

Intrusion Detection System (IDS). IDSes perform real-time analysis of network
traffic and application logs. It raises an alert and can log activity when it
detects suspicious activity.



3) An administrator is configuring a firewall at the Session layer of the OSI
model. What kind of firewall is the administrator implementing?

Stateful inspection firewall. This is a layer 5 firewall that checks incoming
packets to confirm whether it belongs to an existing connection.



4) An organization is using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to
centrally manage IP addressing. All clients on the network are receiving IP
address autoconfiguration except the clients on a new subnet. What is the most
likely reason?

The router on that subnet doesn't support BOOTP forwarding, so traffic cannot get
to the clients.



5) An administrator can ping a server by IP address but cannot ping the server by
its name. What are some areas the administrator should check to find out why the
name isn’t resolving to the IP address? (Select all that apply.)

Check the local cache.
Check the HOSTS file.
Query the DNS server.



6) An organization purchased a new router with built-in firewall features. The
administrator configured the new appliance and it worked as expected. However,
after 90 days the firewall stopped working. What is the most likely cause?

The trial period ended.



7) A Windows user is trying to remote desktop into an application server. Although
the user can ping the FQDN, they are unable to establish a connection. What is
most likely the cause?

Firewall blocking TCP/3389. The key here is "remote desktop". RDP runs on TCP/3389.



8) Which service maps ports and documents the mappings for new webserver
connections and then substitutes the private IP address for a public IP address
before sending the request to the public Internet? (Select all that apply.)

Port Address Translation (PAT) or Network Address Port Translation (NAPT) allocate
port mappings in the state table and then subtitute the private IP for the public
IP and then forwards it to the internet.



9) An administrator is configuring a new network from the ground up. Which servers
would the administrator configure as bastion hosts? (Select all that apply.)

Proxy servers
Web servers

Bastion hosts sit on the edge of a network, therefore we configure internet facing
devices as bastion hosts.



10) An administrator has plugged in a new security camera, but when accessing the
camera’s web management interface, the administrator encounters a self-signed
certificate error. What should the administrator do?

Replace the default certificate. The key here is "self-signed", so the holder is
the issuer of the cert, so thhe admin should replace his own cert.



LESSON 15 TESTS - DEPLOYING AND TROUBLESHOOTING WIRELESS NETWORKS

---
BOOK 15A

1) What mechanism does RTS/CTS support?

area, each access point must be configured with the same SSID, security
parameters, and Wi-Fi channel.

True.



5) What type of AP requires a wireless controller?

Thin AP.



6) What are the advantages of deploying a wireless mesh topology over an
IBSS?

Mesh topologies are more scaleable and do not require a controller. 802.11s
devices can directly connect to one another.

BOOK 15C

1) You are planning WLAN for an office building with an attached
warehouse. Where would you recommend placing Wi-Fi antennas for the
best coverage in an office full of cubicles as well as in the warehouse?

Mounted on the ceiling with a vertical type antenna.



2) The lobby area of your office building has undergone a renovation, the
centerpiece of which is a large aquarium in the middle of the room,
separating a visitor seating and greeting area from the reception desks,
where the AP facilitating guest Internet access is located. Since the
renovation, many guests have been unable to connect to Wi-Fi from the
seating area. Could the aquarium really be the cause, and what solution
could you recommend?

Yes, glass, mirrors, and water refract, reflect, and absorb radio waves.
We can place the AP above the aquarium or add another AP to the other side
of it to act as a repeater.



3) What is the difference between a Wi-Fi analyzer and a spectrum
analyzer?

WiFi analyzers filter out all signals but WiFi signals, spectrum analyzers
read all sorts of signals.



4) Users in the corner of an office building cannot get good Wi-Fi reception.
Your office manager doesnʼt want to use his budget to purchase a new
AP. Heʼs noticed that the power level control on the AP is set to 3 out of 5
and wants to know why turning up the power isnʼt the best solution?

Turning the power level up may cause compatibility issues with clients, which
in turn would lead to packet sending errors and retransmission. The best idea
hhere is to pay out for another AP or configure a wireless bridge with
directional antennas.

BOOK 15D

1) What is the main difference between WPA and WPA2?

WPA2 uses AES.



2) What configuration information is required on an access point to
authenticate users joining the wireless network against a network
authentication server?

The authentication method must be set to enterprise and the AP must be
configured with the IP address and shared secret of the RADIUS or
TACACS+ server.



3) Widget Corporation has provided wireless access for its employees using
several APs located in different parts of the building. Employees connect
to the network using 802.11g-compatible network cards. On Thursday
afternoon, several users report that they cannot log on to the network.
What troubleshooting step would you take first?

Check device compatibility with authentication methods.



4) Why might an attacker launch a disassociation attack against an access
point?

DoS attack to prevent network access, or an attempt to use an evil twin/rogue
AP to intercept network traffic.



5) Your company has a lobby area where guest access is provided so that
visitors can get Internet access. The open guest WLAN is currently
connected to the production network. The only protection against
visitors and hackers getting into the organizationʼs data is file and
directory rights. What steps should be taken to provide guest access and
better protect the organizationʼs data?

The guest WLAN should be separated on another network segment using VLANs
and a firewall to separate traffic. Configuring a captive portal would be
helpful as well.
