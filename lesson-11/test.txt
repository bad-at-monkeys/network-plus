1) A growing organization wants an elementary web presence for its business. They
do not intend to perform any e-commerce with their website. Which of the following
is the best option for the organization to move forward with?

Shared hosting. This is the most elementary, cost-effective setup.



2) An organization has secured its website with SSL/TLS
(Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security). By default, what port will
this encrypted traffic use?

TCP/443



3) A server is running Microsoft SQL Server and is replicating the data to other
Microsoft SQL servers on the network. The application service is using which
principal port?

TCP/1433



4) An organization needs to use shared mailboxes for managing customer inquiries.
What mailbox access protocol should the clients utilize to retrieve the mail over
secured connections?

IMAPS



5) An admin is using FTP and the PROT command. What type of FTP is this?

Active FTP. Active FTP uses the PROT command to transfer data securely.
Passive FTP uses the PASV command.



6) A mail administrator configured the DNS server to allow connections on
TCP port 53. Why would the administrator make this kind of configuration?

The network is using IPv6. DNS is typically run over UDP/53, but IPv6 requires
larger transfers of 512bytes+.



7) An administrator updated an A (address) record, but it took the client
computers approximately five minutes to recognize the change. What update can
the administrator make on the resource record to allow changes to propagate
through the network more quickly?

Decrease the TTL. If the TTL is decreased, then the query in cache will be
updated more frequently.



8) An organization is converting from landline telephones to VoIP handsets.
Some of the current landline locations do not have electrical outlets nearby.
What can the organization use to power the replacement handsets in these cases?
(Select all that apply.)

PoE
Batteries



9) An organization is looking to secure email, what could they implement?

SMTPS
STARTTLS



10) What tools can a Windows administrator use to troubleshoot DNS issues
without installing additional software? (Select all that apply.)

nslookup
ipconfig /all

dig isn't a standard tool.
hostname --fqdn is a linux command.



11) Which of the following remote print protocols allows secure connections to
a print device and allows it to advertise service capabilities over the network,
provide plug-and-play installation for Windows and iOS devices, and use
bidirectional status messaging?

Web Services for Devices (WSD)/AirPrint



12) An organization is converting from landline telephones to VoIP handsets, but
still needs to use fax machines in many of the offices. What can the organization
use to allow the fax machines to operate on the new VoIP system?

VoIP gateway



13) An organization is using video conferencing to conduct meetings between
different locations. Which of the following protocols provides information that
allows the network stacks to adjust the quality of service parameters?

RTCP. RTP Control Protocol is a session on each RTP stream that monitors the
quality of the connection and provides metrics that the network stacks use
to tune QoS params.



14) During an office upgrade, a technician is tasked with configuring the DNS server. What ports can be used when configuring a DNS service? (Select all that Apply).

TCP/53 or UDP/53. DNS is typically run over UDP/53, but can be run over TCP for
larger transfers.
