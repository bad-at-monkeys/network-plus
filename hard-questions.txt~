HARD QUESTIONS - NETWORK+

These are questions that I missed in MeasureUp or the book that I should work on.

---


3) What component performs signal amplification to extend the maximum
   allowable distance for a media type?

Repeater


---


11) How is the decimal value 171 expressed in hex?

0xAB

  -> Divide 171 by 16 until QUOTIENT is zero.
     171 / 16 = 10%11
     10 / 16 = 0%10
  -> 10 = A
     11 = B
  -> 0xAB

In binary - 10101011

13) Which grade or grades of fiber have a 62.5 micron core?

MMF(OM1,OM2)


---


14) Which fiber Ethernet standard is best suited to implementing backbone
    cabling that does not exceed 200 m (656 feet) and can achieve at least
    4 Gbps throughput?

10GBASE-SR MMF(OM1,OM2)


---


22) You have selected an SFP+ 1310 nm Tx and 1490 nm Rx transceiver to
    implement a BiDi link between two switches. Should you provision a
    second SFP+ 1310 nm Tx and 1490 nm Rx for the other switch?

No, we need an SFP+ module with 1490nm Tx and 1310nm Rx.


---


18) A network technician needs a cost-effective solution that can multiplex
    up to 16 wavelengths on an SFP/SFP+ interface. Which multiplexing
    technique should the network technician use?

CWDM supports up to 16 wavelengths and typically deploys 4 or 8 bidirectional
channels over a single fiber strand.


---


1) You need to verify whether a switch port is misconfigured by checking
the number of collisions being reported. What general command could
you use at a CLI to report this information?

# sh interface


---


4) A network engineer is setting up MTU sizes to follow most Ether products.
In normal conditions, what is the maximum size of a standard Ethernet frame,
excluding the preamble?

1518bytes


---


8) A network architect is assessing network performance. Which of the following
is part of the CSMA/CD protocol to identify collisions early?

Preamble
SFD


---


11) A network technician is setting up a connection between switches, but
the switches cannot establish a connection. Which of the following would be
the most likely cause of the switch's inability to establish a connection?

Dual MDI-X ports


---


A network admin implements a change on a switch to fix a network issue.
What should the admin do next?

Implement preventative measures.


---


A company wants to implement authentication and authorization solution for
network devices that also directly supports device management.

TACACS+

(RADIUS doesn't support device management)


---


An admin wants to deploy new wlan topology without running new wiring.
Must support 5Ghz, MU-MIMO, speeds of 2100Mbps, PoE 25W+.
What two components must be used?

An AP supporting 802.11ax Wave 2 (5Ghz, MU-MIMO, 2Gbps+).
A switch supporting 802.3at (PoE).


---


The connection between an access and distribution switch is over utilized.
Which should a network engineer use to increase bandwidth between the switches?

Link Aggregation Control Protocol(LACP)

Can be used to increase bandwidth between switches. LACP aggregates two or more
Ethernet interfaces, allowing the interfaces to operate on a single virtual
interface. LACP must be configured on both switches and the same number of ports
must be added to the LACP channel on both ends.

DHCP - Application
SMTP - Application
ICMP - Network
TCP - Transport
DNS - Application
FTP - Application


---


A vulnerability is a flaw or weakness in security that could lead to a security
breach.

An exploit is an attack that takes advantage of a vulnerability.


---


VLAN hopping is an attack in which the attackers computer gains access to a
port that would normally not be accessible to that computer. A way to carry
out this attack is by double tagging frames with the attack switch and the
target switch, making it look like the frame was intended for the target
switch.


---


SNMP can collect performance and event information from network devices and
configure SNMP agents on nodes allowing for device config modification.


---


An admin suspects a WAP antenna needs to be replaced. Which antenna type
should be used to maximize gain?

A parabolic dish antenna. Like a satellite dish, heavily focusing RF energy in
a tight beam (i.e. maximizing gain).


---


If an AP has over 50 clients, a general rule of thumb is that more APs need to
be added.


---


MFA must have one or more differing factors:
  -> Something you know
  -> Something you have
  -> Something you are
  -> Something you do
  -> Somewhere you are


---


VNC is platform independent, RDP is Windows proprietary


---


A company wants to connect a remote office using a satellite internet service.
What is the main concern for this deployment?

Latency, which is described as the amount of delay that occurs during a data
transmission.


---


An admin is concerned about the security of east-west traffic flows.
Whhat is best to address these concerns?

Place firewalls between datacenter segments. East-west traffic flow is the flow of
traffic between endpoints within the same datacenter.


---


An ISP has installed a DWDM device. Why?

To solve the fiber exhaust problem.

Network Masks
A 32-bit network mask is what distinguishes the Network ID from the Host ID.

The mask conceals the host ID portion and leaves the network portion revealed.
Wherever there is a binary one in the netmask, it corresponds with the net ID.

This is a process called ANDing. We are ANDing the mask to the IP address,
because when two 1s are ANDed together the result is 1. Any other combo
returns a 0.

Let's determine the network ID:

1) First AND the two addresses to binary
198.51.100.1    =    11000110 00110011 01100100 00000001
                                  AND
255.255.255.0   =    11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
                                   =
198.51.100.0    =    11000110 00110011 01100100 00000000
