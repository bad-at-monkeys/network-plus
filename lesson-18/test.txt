LESSON 18 TESTS - DISASTER RECOVERY AND HIGH AVAILABILITY CONCEPTS

---
BOOK 18A

1) Which metric is used to determine frequency of data backups?

Recovery Point Objective (RPO).



2) A server group installed with storage devices from Vendor A experiences
two failures across 20 devices over a period of 5 years. A server group
using storage devices from Vendor B experiences one failure across
12 devices over the same period. Which metric is being tracked and
which vendorâ€™s metric is superior?

Mean Time to Failure (MTTF). Used for devices that cannot be repaired.



3) 515web have experienced three web server outages in the last five years.
These outages all occurred in separate years and caused one hour, three
hour, and one hour downtime incidents. Assuming the company uses
the same value for MTD and RTO, did the company meet the RTO of two
hours specified in the SLA agreed annually with its customers?

No. RTO is equal to the maximum amount of downntime. The single incident causing
3hrs of downtime breaks the SLA. The SLA was yearly, not an average of all the
years.



4) What type of failover site generally requires only data to be restored
before it can resume processing?

Warm



5) What rack-mountable device can provide line filtering and power
monitoring features?

PDU

BOOK 18B

1) Why might contracting with multiple ISPs still fail to provide highly
available Internet access infrastructure?

They may use the same services which in turn, may be down.



2) True or false? Link aggregation can only be configured between
intermediate systems, such as switch-to-switch or switch-to-router.

False, link aggregation can be used between end systems and intermediate systems.



3) You are configuring a load balanced web application. Which IP
address should be configured as a host record in DNS to advertise
the application?

The virtual IP.



4) What is the purpose of HSRP and VRRP?

Provides failover for a group of routers.

1) While evaluating load balancers, a network engineer needs to acquire a switch
that can handle complex logic. Which switch would the engineer use for this
requirement?

Layer 7 switch.



2) A network contractor reviews key performance indicators regarding the time
taken to correct a fault and restore the system to full operation. What is the
name of this process?

MTTR



3) A network engineer decides that the organization needs to purchase a device
that "cleans" the power signal, provides protection against spikes, surges, and
brownouts, and can integrate with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). What is
the name of this device?

PDU



4) A network technician needs to install a load balancer onto the network as the
department has experienced issues with streaming media servers. What switches
could the technician use to support this request? (Select all that apply.)

Layyer 4 switch
Layer 7 switch



5) A network consultant is looking for a device that will serve as a temporary
power source in the event of a blackout. What is the name of this device?

UPS



6) A network specialist wants to provision two load balancer appliances so that if one fails, the other can still handle client connections. What type of load balancer distribution method should the network specialist use?

Virtual IP



7) A network technician confirms that the server room has adequate environmental
controls to mitigate the loss of availability through mechanical issues with
equipment, such as overheating. What service provides environmental control in
the room?

HVAC



8) A network contractor evaluates a protocol that allows multiple physical
routers to serve as a single default gateway for a subnet. What is the name of
this protocol?

HSRP



9) A network specialist analyzes the key performance indicators associated with
the component reliability regarding the expected lifetime of repairable
products. What reliability analysis is the network specialist conducting?

Mean Time Between Failures (MTTB)



10) A network engineer deploys a hardware appliance to distribute client
requests across server nodes in a farm or pool. What is the name of this
appliance?

Load balancer
