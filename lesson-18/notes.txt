LESSON 18 - EXPLAINING DISASTER RECOVERY AND HIGH AVAILABIILITY CONCEPTS

EXPLAIN DISASTER RECOVERY CONCEPTS

High Availability

HA is the characteristic of a system that can guarantee certain levels of
availability.

Maximum Tolerant Downtime (MDS) states the requirement for a business to funciton.

Availability    Annual Downtime
---             ---
99.9999%  --->  00:00:32
99.999%   --->  00:05:15
99.99%    --->  00:52:34
99.9%     --->  08:45:36
99%       --->  87:36:00


The MTD metric sets the upper limit on the amount of recovery time that system
and asset owners have to resume operations. Other metrics can be used:
  -> Recovery Objective Time (RTO); the period following a disaster that an
     individual IT system may remain offline. Maximum amount of time allowed to
     identify that there is a problem and then perform recovery.
  -> Work Recovery Time (WRT); work reintegration from different systems following
     recovery. RTO + WRT must not exceed MTD.
  -> Recovery Point Objective (RPO); amount of data loss that a system can
     sustain.

Fault Tolerance and Redundancy

KPIs are used to determine the reliability of each asset and assess whether
goals for MTO, RTO, and RPO can be met. Main KPIs relating to component
reliability:
  -> Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF); expected lifetime of a product.
  -> Mean Time to Failure (MTTF); expected lifetime of a non-repairable system.
  -> Mean Time to Repair (MTTR); measure of the time taken to bring a system to
     full operation from a fault.

Fault-tolerant systems are ones that can have individual components and sub-
systems fail, but maintain acceptable service.

Fault tolerant devices include:
  -> Redundant spares; power supplies, network cards, storage, routers ..
  -> Network links; we need backup links
  -> UPSs, generators and other stand-by power supplies.
  -> Backup strategies
  -> Cluster services





---
Recovery Sites

Various recovery site types:
  -> Hot site; can failover almost instantly. Everything is ready to operate
     right away.
  -> Warm site; similar, but the latest data sets may not be present.
  -> Cold site; everything needs to be set up.

Facilities and Infra Support

HVAC



Fire Suppression

Power Management

PDUs

Convert DC to AC, or even AC into cleaner AC.



UPSs

Temporary power source during outages.



Generators





---
Network Device Backup Management

Two backup modes are typically supported:
  -> State/bare metal; snapshot of the system that can be deployed to any other
     like system.
  -> Configuration file; these are like ansible playbooks.

EXPLAIN HIGH AVAILABILITY CONCEPTS

---
Multipathing

Meaning a network node has more than one physical link to another.

Common multipathing scenarios:
  -> SAN multipathing; SAN servers share storage over a network link.
  -> Multiple ISPs; having a single ISP operate a link represents a single point
     of failure.

Diverse paths refers to provisioning links over separate cable conduits that are
physically distant from eachother.





---
Link Aggregating vs NIC Teaming

Link aggregation is combining two or more separate cabled links between a host
and a switch into a single logical channel.

From the host end, this is called NIC teaming.

At the switch end it is called port aggregation.

Cisco calls this Etherchannel.

Link aggregation is implemented using the IEEE 802.3ad/802.1ax standard.

802.3ad bonded interfaces are described as a Link Aggregation Group (LAG) which
implements Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). LACP detects configuration
errors and recovers from the failure of one of the physical links.





---
Load Balancers

A hardware or software appliance that distributes client requests across
server nodes in a pool.

Load balancers are placed in front of the server network and distributes the
requests from the client network or Internet to the application servers.

The service address is advertised as a virtual server.

The two main types of load balancers include:
  -> Layer 4 switch; makes forwarding decisions based off IP address and TCP/UDP
     header values, working at the transport layer.
  -> Layer 7 switch (content switch); makes forwarding decisions based off of
     application level data.





---
Redundant Hardware Clusters

Clustering allows multiple redundant processing nodes that share data with
eachother to accept connections.

To clients, a cluster would seem as a single server.



Virtual IP

Virtual IPs are also called shared/floating addresses. This type of IP is shared
between two instances in a cluster, so if one goes down the IP doesn't change
between devices.

CARP is typically used to acheive this.



Active-Passive and Active-Active Clustering

Active-passive = one node active, other passive
Active-active = both nodes processing connections concurrently





---
Frst Hop Redundancy

HSRP

Developed by Cisco, allows multiple physical routers to serve as a single default
gateway for a subnet. Each router must have an interface connected to the subnet.
They also must be configured to share the same IP and MAC. This group is called
the stanby group.



Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol

VRRP is similar to HSRP. The difference being in terminology and packet formats.
It is possible to configure all of the routers with the same virtual IP in VRRP.
