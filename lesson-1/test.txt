LESSON 1 - REVIEW

1) At which OSI layer is the concept of a port number introduced?

Layer 4 - Transport



2) At which layer of the OSI model is no header encapsulation applied?

Layer 1 - Physical



3) What component performs signal amplification to extend the maximum
   allowable distance for a media type?

Repeater



4) Which OSI layer packages bits of data from the Physical layer into
   frames?

Layer 2 - Data-link



5) True or False? The Session layer is responsible for passing data to the
   Network layer at the lower bound and the Presentation layer at the
   upper bound.

False, the Session Layer(5) has the Transport(4) as the lower-bound
and the Presentation(6) as the upper-bound.



6) True or false? The WAN port on a SOHO router is connected to the LAN
   ports by an internal switch.

False. The LAN ports and WAP are connected by a switch.

The WAN port is seperate, packets must be routed between the LAN and
WAN segments.



7) What type of address is used by the switch to forward transmissions to
   the appropriate host?

Physical Address. Typically MAC addresses in modern networks.



8) True or false? The DHCP server in the SOHO router assigns an IP address
   to the WAN interface automatically.

False. The ISP assigns the WAN IP, the router uses DHCP to assign addresses
locally to the host within its LAN.



9) What function or service prevents an Internet host from accessing
   servers on the LAN without authorization?

Firewall.



10) How is the decimal value 12 expressed in hex?

0xC

11) How is the decimal value 171 expressed in hex?

0xAB

  -> Divide 171 by 16 until QUOTIENT is zero.
     171 / 16 = 10%11
     10 / 16 = 0%10
  -> 10 = A
     11 = B
  -> 0xAB

In binary - 10101011
