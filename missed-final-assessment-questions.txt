These are the questions that I missed following my first attempt of the CompTIA
Network+ Final Assessment - Practice.

My first attempt --- I barely completed in time, I actually ran out on the last
question. I got a 61% and even cheated and guessed on quite a few questions.

This is a pretty awful score given that I need an 80% to pass. Let's try harder.

*****
2nd Attempt 76% with 19min remaining.

We missed the compound situational problems which accounted for the majority of
missed points.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MTD = longest period of time that a business function outage may occur without
      causing irrecoverable business failure.

      12hrs in this case.



MTTR = (total repair time / number of incidents)

There were 2 incidents.

total repair time = 18 + 19 + 3

MTTR = (18 + 19 + 3) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20hrs



MTBF = (devices * hrs) / (number of failures)

There were 3 servers.
There were 2 failures.
They ran for 250hrs each for 750hrs.

( 3 * 250 ) / 2 = 750 / 2 = 375



MTTF = (devices * hrs) / (number of devices)

6 devices.
Running for 250hrs each for 1500hrs.

( 6 * 250 ) / 6 = 1500 / 6 = 250



RPO = the amount of data loss that a systemm can sustain, measured in time.

They said a data loss of more than 9hrs is damaging to the business, so the RPO
is 9hrs. The last backup was 12hrs ago, leaving 3hrs of missing data.

T56A = 2nd wire is green
T56B = 2nd wire is blue

When using a Wireless Distribution System, all repeaters must be on the same
channel as the main AP. In this case it was 7.

The roaming aggressiveness setting for clients in an isolated setting should be
set to LOW AGGRESSIVENESS.

The roaming aggressiveness for clients is a setting with many nearby APs should be
set to MEDIUM.

A network administrator is with a major company that cannot handle downtime and
requires redundancy at every level possible. They need to set up multiple
physical routers to serve as a single default gateway for a subnet, but do not
want to use a proprietary protocol. Which of the following will help them
accomplish this? (Select all that apply.)

CARP; Common Address Redundancy Protocol enables multiple hosts to share an IP
address on the same network segment so that they can act as a default gateway.

VRRP; Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol allows the automatic assignment of IP
routers to act as a default gateway on a single host.



WHAT IT IS NOT:

HSRP; this does combine a bunch of routers etc...but it's proprietary.

LACP; this isn't even close. Link Aggregation Control Protocol detects
configuration errors an recovers from the failure of one of the physical links.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Windows server manager is trying to calculate the amount of data loss that a
system can sustain, measured in time units. What is this referred to as?

RPO; Recovery Point Objective is the amount of data loss that a system can sustain
measured in time units.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A network engineer is configuring an Internet of Things (IoT) network that uses
multicasting to allow devices to communicate over a VLAN-enabled managed switch.
An issue is occurring where the multicast traffic is being flooded across the
network as a broadcast, resulting in reduced network performance. Recommend a
potential fix for this issue.

Ensure IGMP snooping is enabled at the switch.

To prevent multicast flooding, IGMP snooping can be enabled as a global option on
a switch and as a per-VLAN option. IGMP snooping means the switch reads IGMP
messages and can determine if the host on an access port or one or more hosts in
a VLAN have joined a multicast group.



WHAT IT ISN'T:

Ensure DHCP server is correctly configured.

DHCP is not related to multicast flooding issues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A network engineer is configuring a local intranet for a large manufacturing
company that uses a DNS server on its network to resolve internal and external
queries while keeping internal IP addresses private. The engineer sets both UDP
port 53 and TCP port 53 on the primary name resolution server to allow larger DNS
record transfers. Select the situations that would require larger DNS record
transfers over TCP. (Select all that apply.)

The DNS server is utilizing security protocols such as DNSSEC. Security protocols
such as DNSSEC authenticate responses to domain name lookups in order to prevent
attackers from manipulating or poisoning the responses to DNS requests.

A network engineer is testing an application over the IPv6 protocol. Determine
how the server can cast packets to an entire local subnet.

Multicast to associated private topology.

3rd Attempt

91% with an hour to spare.

I don't understand the compound problems still.

A network engineer is testing an application over the IPv6 protocol. Determine
how the server can cast packets to an entire local subnet.

Multicast to associated private topology

The Multicast Listener Discovery protocol allows nodes to join a multicast group
and discover whether members of a group are present on a local subnet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A data center network administrator working for a cloud services company is
configuring an SDN that is optimized for east-west traffic. The SDN must be
loop-free so that spanning tree protocol is not required, instead utilizing a
protocol called Equal Cost Multipathing (ECMP) to distribute traffic between
the links to the top-tier switches. Most importantly, all server resources wil
l be on-premises, so the solution should avoid the use of the public Internet and
the use of Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) protocols, instead establishing
private links with guaranteed service levels to operate as an overlay network and
configure point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links between nodes without
respect to the underlying physical and data link topologies (in other words,
tunneling through the network layer). The SDN must also feature multipath
redundancy to allow for load balancing and failover. Choose a multipath routing
protocol that will best fulfill these requirements.

(We knew this one)
MPLS with SPB. Shortest Path Bridging and Multiprotocol Label Switching can be
used together with private links, using SPB and IS-IS (spf algorithm) as a link-
layer overlay and MPLS as a link-layer-independent "Layer 2.5" underlay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A manufacturing company utilizes multiple access points (APs) spread across its
factory. The APs all share an SSID to allow client roaming. Since there are areas
where it is difficult to run cabling, a wireless distribution system is used,
where the main router is connected to the Internet and the rest are set in
repeater mode. What is true about the channels used by the APs?

APs should avoid using channels that overlap.
