LESSON 6 TEST - SUPPORTING IPV4 AND IPV6 NETWORKS

---
BOOK 6A

1) How can you check the IP configuration of an interface on an end system
host at the command line?

> ipconfig /all
$ ifconfig
$ ip addr [interface]



2) What output would you expect when running the command ip neigh?

The local area network neighbors listed with their IP address, MAC address
pairs.



3) True or False? The arp utility will always show another hostʼs MAC
address if that host is on the same subnet.

False. Sometimes the MAC won't show because a broadcast hasn't been
sent out for that device yet. We must ping the destination first to
create an ARP entry.



4) Output from a ping command reports some values in milliseconds. What
does this measure?

The round-trip request/reply process of the packet.



5) True or False? Receiving an echo reply message indicates that the link
between two hosts is operational.

True. This means that there is a working route between the two hosts.

BOOK 6B

1) Users on a floor served by a single switch cannot get a network
connection. What is the best first step?

Check that the switch is powered on, reset it.
Check to see if the port module is fully seated.



2) A workstation cannot connect to a server application on a remote
network. What is the first test you could perform to establish whether
the workstationʼs link is OK?

Ping the default gateway.



3) A technician is troubleshooting a network and has asked your advice. He
is trying to ping 192.168.16.192. The network has been subnetted with
the custom mask 255.255.255.224. Why might this return a “Destination
host unreachable” message?

The IP address resolves to the subnet network address, not a host address.



4) Two client hosts have intermittent connectivity issues when accessing
a server service on another subnet. No other client hosts exhibit this
problem. What configuration problem might you suspect?

Duplicate IP/MAC addresses.



5) You have pinged the router for the local subnet and confirmed that there
is a valid link. The local host cannot access remote hosts, however. No
other users are experiencing problems. What do you think is the cause?

The router isn't configured as the default gateway for the local host.
We can ping it, but the host isn't using it for routing.



6) A Windows client workstation cannot access a help desk application
server by its name support.515support.com. The service can be accessed
using its IP address. What two command line tools should you use to
identify possible causes of this issue?

$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
ping and ipconfig /all
we can also use nslookup and dig

BOOK 6C

1) Which of the following IPv6 addresses is a valid unicast host address?

fe80::218:8bff:fea7:bd37
fe80::219:d2ff::7850
ff02::219:d2ff:fea7:7850
::/128

fe80::218:8bff:fea7:bd37



2) What is an EUI-64, and how might it be used by IPv6?

It is MAC address and can be used as the IPv6 interface ID, though a
randomly generated token better suits this purpose.



3) In IPv6, how is the loopback address best expressed?

::1



4) In IPv6, how can a host obtain a routable IPv6 address without requiring
manual configuration?

SLAAC allows hosts to autoconfigure an interface by listening to router
advertisements to obtain a network prefix.



5) True or false? 6to4 is a dual stack method of transitioning from IPv4
to IPv6.

False. 6to4 is a tunneling method that encapsulates IPv6 packets in IPv4 UDP
packets.

Online Test

1) A security engineer is analyzing IPv6 packets. Which of the following
header fields is for quality of service?

Flow label. The flow label is for QoS management for real-time streams.
The flow label is set to 0 for packets not part of any delivery sequence
or structure.



2) A network administrator is diagnosing a suspected problem with local
addressing and packet delivery. Which of the following commands would
the administrator use to add an entry to the ARP cache?

$ arp -s [ip-add] [mac-add]
This command adds an entry to the arp cache



3) A consultant is visiting a new project and forgot to take the manual
configurations off the computer from the last project. The client receives
issues due to a disabled IP. What does the client most likely have?

Duplicate IPs. Windows will disable the IP if it is a duplicate.
Linux doesn't check for duplicate IPs by default.



4) A helpdesk technician is troubleshooting issues on a Windows client.
Which command does the technician use to clear the current IP address so
that a new one may be obtained?

>ipconfig /release



5) A security technician is analyzing IPv6 traffic and looking at incomplete
addresses. Which of the following is a correct IPv6 address?

2001:db8:abc:def0::1234. Remember that the :: can only be used once.



6) A network administrator is diagnosing a suspected problem with local
addressing and packet delivery. Which of the following commands would
the administrator use to flush the ARP cache?

$ arp -d



7) A network administrator is setting up router advertisements through
Neighbor Discovery protocol on an IPv6 network. Which of the following is
NOT one of the main functions?

Error messaging. This is actually a feature of ICMPv6.



8) A Linux systems administrator wants to interface correctly with modern
network configuration manager packages. Which of the following would be best
to accomplish this?

iproute2. Net-tools was replaced with iproute2.



9) A network technician is setting up IPv6 global addressing. Which of the
following is NOT part of an IPv6 unicast address?

Starts with fe80. This is for link local addresses.
Global addresses start with 001.



10) A security technician is analyzing packets on an IPv6 network. Which
of the following headers would indicate a multicast packet?

1111 1111 or ff
The first 8-bits indicate that the address is within the multicast scope.



11) A helpdesk technician is trying to troubleshoot a client who is having
issues with its network adapter. What should the technician try first?

Driver.



12) A device is having issues communicating with the others. Which of the
following will have issues?

Host A: IP: 192.168.1.10, Mask: 255.255.255.0
Host B: IP: 192.168.1.11, Mask: 255.255.255.0
Host C: IP: 192.168.1.21, Mask: 255.255.0.0
Host D: IP: 192.168.0.10, Mask: 255.255.255.0

Host D will not be able to communicate with the others. Host C cannot contact
Host D, as it thinks Host D is on the same local network. Host C needs to route
messages for 192.168.0.0/24 via the default gateway.



13) A helpdesk technician is setting up a new IP configuration for a new
Ethernet adapter on a client using PowerShell. Which command should
the technician use?

New-NetIPAddress. Powershell uses cmdlets like these to carry out tasks.
netsh is the way to do it on cmd.



14) A network technician is trying to diagnose a network where something is
consuming a lot of bandwidth and slowing down the network. Which of the
following would point to this?

Multicast transmissions. At layer2, if a switch isn't multicast aware it
will treat multicast transmissions as broadcasts adnd flood all ports on
the device.



15) A project manager is visiting a new building and connects to the network.
The manager performs all connectivity tests by IP address but cannot ping
by host name. What is most likely the problem?

DNS.
