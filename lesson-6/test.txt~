LESSON 6 TEST - SUPPORTING IPV4 AND IPV6 NETWORKS

---
BOOK 6A

1) How can you check the IP configuration of an interface on an end system
host at the command line?

> ipconfig /all
$ ifconfig
$ ip addr [interface]



2) What output would you expect when running the command ip neigh?

The local area network neighbors listed with their IP address, MAC address
pairs.



3) True or False? The arp utility will always show another hostʼs MAC
address if that host is on the same subnet.

False. Sometimes the MAC won't show because a broadcast hasn't been
sent out for that device yet. We must ping the destination first to
create an ARP entry.



4) Output from a ping command reports some values in milliseconds. What
does this measure?

The round-trip request/reply process of the packet.



5) True or False? Receiving an echo reply message indicates that the link
between two hosts is operational.

True. This means that there is a working route between the two hosts.

BOOK 6B

1) Users on a floor served by a single switch cannot get a network
connection. What is the best first step?

Check that the switch is powered on, reset it.
Check to see if the port module is fully seated.



2) A workstation cannot connect to a server application on a remote
network. What is the first test you could perform to establish whether
the workstationʼs link is OK?

Ping the default gateway.



3) A technician is troubleshooting a network and has asked your advice. He
is trying to ping 192.168.16.192. The network has been subnetted with
the custom mask 255.255.255.224. Why might this return a “Destination
host unreachable” message?

The IP address resolves to the subnet network address, not a host address.



4) Two client hosts have intermittent connectivity issues when accessing
a server service on another subnet. No other client hosts exhibit this
problem. What configuration problem might you suspect?

Duplicate IP/MAC addresses.



5) You have pinged the router for the local subnet and confirmed that there
is a valid link. The local host cannot access remote hosts, however. No
other users are experiencing problems. What do you think is the cause?

The router isn't configured as the default gateway for the local host.
We can ping it, but the host isn't using it for routing.



6) A Windows client workstation cannot access a help desk application
server by its name support.515support.com. The service can be accessed
using its IP address. What two command line tools should you use to
identify possible causes of this issue?

$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
ping and ipconfig /all
we can also use nslookup and dig

BOOK 6C

1) Which of the following IPv6 addresses is a valid unicast host address?

fe80::218:8bff:fea7:bd37
fe80::219:d2ff::7850
ff02::219:d2ff:fea7:7850
::/128

fe80::218:8bff:fea7:bd37



2) What is an EUI-64, and how might it be used by IPv6?

It is MAC address and can be used as the IPv6 interface ID, though a
randomly generated token better suits this purpose.



3) In IPv6, how is the loopback address best expressed?

::1



4) In IPv6, how can a host obtain a routable IPv6 address without requiring
manual configuration?

SLAAC allows hosts to autoconfigure an interface by listening to router
advertisements to obtain a network prefix.



5) True or false? 6to4 is a dual stack method of transitioning from IPv4
to IPv6.

False. 6to4 is a tunneling method that encapsulates IPv6 packets in IPv4 UDP
packets.
