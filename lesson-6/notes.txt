LESSON 6 - SUPPORTING IPV4 AND IPV6 NETWORKS

##########
USE APPROPRIATE TOOLS TO TEST IP CONFIGURATION

---
IP Interface Configuration in Windows

Setting the Ethernet interface for dhcp:
>netsh interface ip set address "Ethernet" dhcp

Setting it statically:
netsh interface ip set address "Ethernet" static
10.1.0.1 255.255.255.0 10.1.0.254


>ipconfig
>ipconfig /all
>ipconfig /renew
>ipconfig /release
>ipconfig /displaydns
>ipconfig /flushdns
>ipconfig /registerdns





---
ifconfig and ip

$ ip addr
$ ifconfig

$ ip link
$ ip -s link

Thhese aren't persistent:
$ ip link set eth0 up|down
$ ip addr add|delete





---
ARP Cache Utility

ARP is used to determine what IP address a MAC address is associated with
on the local network.

$ arp -e
$ ip -s neigh





---
Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP)

Used to report errors and send messages about the delivery of a packet.

ICMP messages are generated under error conditions in most unicast types
of traffic. Not for broadcast or multicast.

The ping utility uses configurable ICMP packets.



ping Error Message

Destination host unreachable - There is no routing information. Could be caused
by incorrect host configuration, loss of a router, or routing configuration.

No reply (Requuest timed out) - The host is unavailable or cannot route a reply
to our computer. Requests time out when the TTL reaches 0 because the packet is
looping, congestion is causing delays, or when a host does not respond.

TROUBLESHOOT IP NETWORKS

---
Hardware Failure and Network Interface Issues

We must determine that layer1 and layer2 aren't the issues first in a network.





---
IP Configuration Issues

Incorrect IP address or incorrect subnet.

With incorrect subnet configuration, the host will be able to receive traffic,
but will not be able to create a route for sending replies.





---
Duplicate IP and MAC Address Issues

Detect duplicate replies, for duplicate IP/MAC:
$ arping -D


Duplicate MACs cannot really happen unless the network uses locally
administered addressing.





---
Problem Isolation

Even if configuration seems to check out and we still get errors,
we can isolate problems using a series of ping tests:
  -> Ping the loopback address (127.0.0.1) to verify TCP/IP is installed and
     loaded correctly on the system. If this fails, the TCP/IP stack must
     be reinstalled.
  -> Ping the IP address of the local host to verify it was added correctly and
     to verify that the network adapter is functioning properly. If we cannot
     ping our own address, check the configuration. It could also be an issue
     with the adapter or driver.
  -> Ping the IP address of the default gateway to verify its status and that
     we can communicate with another host on the local network.
  -> Ping the IP of a host on the LAN within the same subnet, testing for local
     configuration or link problems. This could be from an incorrect IP/netmask.
     If these are correct, but it still times out then suspect security, data-
     link, or physical issues.
  -> Ping the IP of a remote host to verify that we can communicate through the
     router to the outside internet. If remote IP addresses cannot be contacted
     then we must check the router configuration. If the gateway is good and
     errors are still occuring, the routing infrastructure must be investigated.





---
Incorrect DNS Issues

If we can't ping by hostname, it's a dnns issue.





---
Multicast Flooding Issues

Multicast groups are established at layer3 by protocols like IGMP.

At layer2, if a switch is not multicast aware, it will treat multicast
transmissions as broadcasts and flood them across all ports slowing down
the network.

IGMP snooping can be enabled on switches to deter the issue. The switch will
read the IGMP message and be able to determine if the host(s) on an access
port or broadcast group need the message.

EXPLAIN IPV6 ADDRESSING SCHEMES

---
IPv4 vs IPv6

IPv6 is the new IPv4.





---
IPv6 Address Format

An IPv6 address contains eight 16-bit numbers (double-byte/double-octet), with
each double-byte number expressed as 4 hex digits:

fe80::421c:83ff:fe84:aa35/64
fe80:0000:0000:421c:83ff:fe84:aa35/64





---
IPv6 Network Prefixes

IPv6 addresses are divided into two 64-bit parts:
  -> Network ID
  -> Interface ID

This represents a network address:
2001:db8:3c4d::/48

While this represents a subnet within that address:
2001:db8:3c4d:0001::/64





---
IPv6 Unicast Addressing

An IPv6 unicast address represents a single network interface.

IPv6 unicast addressing is scoped, where a scope is a region of the network.

Global scopes provide public addressing schemes, while link local schemes
provide the private addressing.

Parts of a global address:
| 001 |   Network ID   |   Subnet   |   Interface ID   |
   |          |              |                |
   3-bit      45-bit         16-bit           64-bit



Interface ID/EUI-64

The EUI-64 is the Interface ID. This is an ID generated from the interface's
MAC address. Device interfaces can be identified and closely monitored by
using a conversion tool to extract the EUI-64 from the IPv6 address.

Privacy extensions use a pseudo-random number on the interface ID,
known as a token. This is a temporary ID that mitigates privacy concerns
when connecting devices to the internet.





---
IPv6 Link Local Addressing

Link local addresses span a single subnet and are not forwarded by routers.

Link local addresses are the equivalent to IPv4's APIPA,
these addresses look like:

fe80::[interface-id]/10

The last 64-bits are the EUI-64.


In IPv6, link local addresses must always be configured on an interface.

Link local addresses are appended with a zone index (scope ID)
of %1(Windows) or %eth0(Linux) which define the source of the
address and make it unique to a link.





---
IPv6 Interface Autoconfiguration and Testing

IPv6 static addressing is rare, but it is used on routers and servers.



Neighbor Discovery Protocol and Router Advertisements

Neighbor Discovery(ND) protocol is like ARP and ICMP but for IPv6,
and it performs the following functions:
  -> Address autoconfiguration
  -> Prefix discovery; uses router advertisements and router solicitation
     to discover the known network prefixes that have been allocated to
     that segment.
  -> Local address resolution; uses neighbor solicitation and neighbor
     advertisements to discover local hosts.
  -> Redirection; routers inform hosts of better routes.



Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

SLAAC is IPv6 DHCP in a more flexible form:
  -> The host generates a link local address and tests that it is unique
     by using ND protocol.
  -> The host listens for router advertisements or transmits a solicitation
     using ND protocol.
  -> The router either provides a network prefix and directs the host to an
     DHCPv6 server to preform stateful auto-config or preforms some kind of
     combo of stateless and stateful autoconfig.



ICMPv6

New features:
Error messaging and informational messaging.





---
IPv6 Multicast Addressing

Used to send a packet from a single source to multiple hosts,
this address looks like:

ff00::/8

Multicast Listener Discovery protocol allows nodes to join a multicast
group and discover whether those members are present on the local subnet.

Broadcast addresses aren't used in IPv6, instead hosts use appropriate
multicast addresses for certain situations:

Solicited node:
ff02::1:ff00:0/104

Link local:
ff02::/16
ff02::1 (all nodes)
ff02::2 (all routers)
fff02::1:2 (DHCP)





---
IPv4 and IPv6 Transition Mechanisms

Dual Stack
  -> Hosts and routers can run IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously and communicate
     with devices confiigured to either type of addressing scheme.
  -> Dual stack is configured on most modern systems.

Tunneling
  -> Can be used to deliver IPv6 across and IPv4 network.
  -> IPv6 packets are encapsulated in IPv4 packets.
  -> High overhead, not as efficient as dual-stack.
  -> 6to4 automatic tunneling - 2002::/16
  -> Replaced with IPv6 Rapid Deployment(6RD)
  -> Teredo is Microsoft's tunneling method for IPv6 packets and
     encapsulates them in IPv4 UDP packets over port 3544.
  -> Miredo is open source Toredo.
  -> GRE can be used to encapsulate IPv6 packets.

                                                  ff02::2 (all routers)
                                                  ff02::1:2 (dhcp)
Solicited node              ff02::1:ff00:0/104    ff02::1:ff
Unspecified                 ::/128                0::0
Loopback                    ::1/128               ::1
Documentation/Examples      2001:db8::/32         2001:db8


Globally unique addresses are referred to as /48s.

0000::/8 is reserved for special functions:
  -> Unspecified address (0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0) - expressed as ::, a host that
     hasn't obtained avalid address.
  -> Loopback (0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1) - expressed as ::1, used for testing if the
     host can send a packet to itself.
