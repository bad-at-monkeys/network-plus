EXPLAIN NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING METHODOLOGY

Network Troubleshooting Methodology

*** MUST STUDY ***
This is CompTIA's metodology.

1) Identify the problem.
     -> Gather information.
     -> ID symptoms and duplicate.
     -> Question users.
     -> Determine changes occured.
     -> Approach multiple problems individually.
2) Establish a theory of probability.
     -> Top-to-bottom, Bottom-to-top OSI Model approach.
          + Decide whether hardware or software related.
	  + Decide whether hardware or subsystem (NIC or cable)
	  + Pinpoint the issue further
	  + Test theory against working devices
     -> Divide and Conquer.
3) Test the theory.
4) Establish a plan of action to resolvethe problem and identify
   potential effects.
5) Implement the solution or escalate as necessary.
6) Verify system functionality, implement preventative measures.
7) Document findings, actions, and outcomes.

TROUBLESHOOT COMMON CABLE CONNECTIVITY ISSUES

Specification and Limitations


Speed vs Throughput

At the physical layer a signal transmitted over a comm channel consists of
symbols. Symbols are any sort of events in series that transition the signal
to the next state.

The number of symbols that can be transmitted per second is the baud rate.
Baud rate is measured in MHz or GHz.

Baud rate = physical


At the data-link layer, the bandwidth of a link is the amount of information
that can be transmitted in bits per second. With the use of encoding methods,
the bit rate will always exceed the baud rate.

Bandwidth = data-link


The speed at which packets are delivered in milliseconds as latency, which
isn't typically an issue on local ethernet networks.

Latency = speed



Distance Limitations, Attenuation, and Noise

Attenuation and noise are what set distance limitations.
  -> Attenuation is the loss of signal strength in dB. dB represents the ratio
     between two measurements; signal strength at origin and destination.
  -> Noise is anything that gets transmitted within or close to the channel
     that isn't the intended signal. This causes the signal to be difficult to
     distinguish, generating errors and forcing retransmission. Noise is
     expressed as signal-to-noise ratio(SNR).

Cable Issues

Ethernet links typically consist of:
  -> Network tranceiver (host/end system)
  -> Patch cable from host to wall port
  -> Structured cable between wall port and patch panel (permanent link)
  -> Patch cable between the patch panel and the switch port
  -> Network transceiver in the switch port (intermediate system)

This entire cable path is the channel link.


Patch cable should be checked first, then transceivers. We can use loopback
tools for bad ports.

If these steps fail, we must test the structured cabling(permanent link).

Loopback Plugs, Status Indicators, and Interference Configuration

Looopback Adapter/Plug
A loopback adapter is a RJ-45 plug with a 6" stub of cable. It has pin 1 (Tx)
to pin 3 (Rx) and pin 2 (Tx) to pin 6 (Rx).

With this connected to a NIC, the NIC sends a packet to itself. We can use this
to test for bad ports.



LED Status Indicators
Typical LED states:
  -> Solid green; connected, no traffic
  -> Blinking green; connected, with traffic flow
  -> No light; not working, disconnected
  -> Blinking amber; fault detected
  -> Solid amber; the port is disabled



Interface Configuration
If there are no other obvious hardware issuues with the NIC, the autonegotiation
process may have failed, speeds may be mismatched, or the duplex settings aren't
correct.

This will be because either the adapter or the switchport has been manually
configured. Configuring both as autonegotiate usually fixes the issue.

Cable Testers

When troubleshooting a permanent link, we must determine that the cable type is
appropriate for the application. Distance, bandwidth, shielded/unshielded, etc.
are all considerations.

Cable testers report detailed information on the physical and electrical
properties of a cable. It can test condition, cross-talk, attenuation, noise,
resistance, etc.

Cable certifiers extensively test a cable run to see that it exceeds spec.
