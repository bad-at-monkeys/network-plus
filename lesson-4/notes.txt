Network Troubleshooting Methodology

*** MUST STUDY ***
This is CompTIA's metodology.

1) Identify the problem.
     -> Gather information.
     -> ID symptoms and duplicate.
     -> Question users.
     -> Determine changes occured.
     -> Approach multiple problems individually.
2) Establish a theory of probability.
     -> Top-to-bottom, Bottom-to-top OSI Model approach.
          + Decide whether hardware or software related.
	  + Decide whether hardware or subsystem (NIC or cable)
	  + Pinpoint the issue further
	  + Test theory against working devices
     -> Divide and Conquer.
3) Test the theory.
4) Establish a plan of action to resolvethe problem and identify
   potential effects.
5) Implement the solution or escalate as necessary.
6) Verify system functionality, implement preventative measures.
7) Document findings, actions, and outcomes.

TROUBLESHOOT COMMON CABLE CONNECTIVITY ISSUES

Specification and Limitations


Speed vs Throughput

At the physical layer a signal transmitted over a comm channel consists of
symbols. Symbols are any sort of events in series that transition the signal
to the next state.

The number of symbols that can be transmitted per second is the baud rate.
Baud rate is measured in MHz or GHz.

Baud rate = physical


At the data-link layer, the bandwidth of a link is the amount of information
that can be transmitted in bits per second. With the use of encoding methods,
the bit rate will always exceed the baud rate.

Bandwidth = data-link


The speed at which packets are delivered in milliseconds as latency, which
isn't typically an issue on local ethernet networks.

Latency = speed



Distance Limitations, Attenuation, and Noise

Attenuation and noise are what set distance limitations.
  -> Attenuation is the loss of signal strength in dB. dB represents the ratio
     between two measurements; signal strength at origin and destination.
  -> Noise is anything that gets transmitted within or close to the channel
     that isn't the intended signal. This causes the signal to be difficult to
     distinguish, generating errors and forcing retransmission. Noise is
     expressed as signal-to-noise ratio(SNR).

Cable Issues

Ethernet links typically consist of:
  -> Network tranceiver (host/end system)
  -> Patch cable from host to wall port
  -> Structured cable between wall port and patch panel (permanent link)
  -> Patch cable between the patch panel and the switch port
  -> Network transceiver in the switch port (intermediate system)

This entire cable path is the channel link.


Patch cable should be checked first, then transceivers. We can use loopback
tools for bad ports.

If these steps fail, we must test the structured cabling(permanent link).

Loopback Plugs, Status Indicators, and Interference Configuration

Looopback Adapter/Plug
A loopback adapter is a RJ-45 plug with a 6" stub of cable. It has pin 1 (Tx)
to pin 3 (Rx) and pin 2 (Tx) to pin 6 (Rx).

With this connected to a NIC, the NIC sends a packet to itself. We can use this
to test for bad ports.



LED Status Indicators
Typical LED states:
  -> Solid green; connected, no traffic
  -> Blinking green; connected, with traffic flow
  -> No light; not working, disconnected
  -> Blinking amber; fault detected
  -> Solid amber; the port is disabled



Interface Configuration
If there are no other obvious hardware issuues with the NIC, the autonegotiation
process may have failed, speeds may be mismatched, or the duplex settings aren't
correct.

This will be because either the adapter or the switchport has been manually
configured. Configuring both as autonegotiate usually fixes the issue.

Cable Testers

When troubleshooting a permanent link, we must determine that the cable type is
appropriate for the application. Distance, bandwidth, shielded/unshielded, etc.
are all considerations.

Cable testers report detailed information on the physical and electrical
properties of a cable. It can test condition, cross-talk, attenuation, noise,
resistance, etc.

Cable certifiers extensively test a cable run to see that it exceeds spec.


A cable tester may implement the function of a time domain reflectometer(TDR).
TDR is used to measure the length of a cable run, detect open and short
circuits, kink/bends, and other imperfections.

Wire Map Testers and Tone Generators

Wire map testers are multimeter type devices that can identify:
  -> Continuity (open) - a conductor does not form a circuit because of cable
     damage or because the connector is not properly wired.
  -> Short - two conductors are joined at the same point.
  -> Incorrect pin-out/termination/standard pair - the conductors are
     incorrectly wired to the terminals at one or both ends of the cable:
       -> Reversed pair - the conductors in a pair were wired to the wrong
          terminal.
       -> Crossed pair (Tx/Rx reverse) - as we see in a crossover cable.
  -> Split pair - both ends of a single wire in one pair are wired to two
     different terminals.


A tone generator and probe are used to trace a cable from one end to the other.

Attenuation and Interference Issues

If the cable link is too long:
  -> Decibel loss, error rates, reTx
  -> Reduced speeds
  -> Loss of connectivity

Insertion loss is measured in decibels and represents the ratio of the received
voltage to the original voltage.

Logarithmic scales are non-linear, so a small change in value represents a
large change in performance:
  -> +3 is doubling, -3 is halving
  -> +6 is quadrupling, -6 relates to a quarter
  -> +10 is multiplying by ten, -10 is a tenth


While measuring insertion loss, smaller values are better. Cable certifiers
can report the margin between actual loss and maximum loss allowed for the
given standard.

High margins are better. Cat5e allows up to 24dB, insertion loss rated at 22dB
is better than 23dB because 23dB is too close to the maximum rate allowed.
We would need a shorter cable run or install a repeater/switch.


Electromagnetic Interference(EMI) iis interference from the environment and
should be checked at intallation.





---
Crosstalk Issues

Crosstalk indicates a problem with bad wiring, connectors, or improper
termination.

Crosstalk is measured in dB, but unlike insertion loss, higher values
represent less noise. The various types of crosstalk that can be measured:
 -> Near End(NEXT) - on the receiver pair at the transmitter end; typically
    caused by untwisting of pairs or faulty shield elements.
 -> Attenuation to Crosstalk Ratio, Near End(ACRN) - difference between the
    insertion loss and NEXT. Equivalent to signal to noise ratio(SNR). A
    high value represents strong signal, low values have high error rate.
 -> Attenuation to Crosstalk Ratio, Far End(ACRF) - Far End Crosstalk (FEXT)
    is measured on the receive pairs at the recipient end. The difference
    between insertion loss and FEXT is ACRF; measuring cable performance
    regardless of length.
 -> Power sum - GbE and 10GbE use all four pairs. PSNEXT, PSACRN, PSACRF
    confirm that a cable is suitable for this type of application

Cable Application Issues

Straight Through and Crossover Cables
  -> Straight through; both ends T56A or B; used to connect differing devices.
  -> Crossover; opposing ends, used to connect like devices.

Auto-MDI/MDI-X solve this issue on all modern GbE ports.



Rollover Cable/Console Cable
  -> Used to interface with the router/switch's console.
     Pale blue, RJ-45 jack or mini-USB.



PoE
Cat3 or better is required for PoE.
PoE+ must be Cat5e or better.

Fiber Optic Cable Testing Tools

Optical Time Domain Reflectometer(OTDR) - pinpoints the location of a break
in fiber.

Optical Spectrum Analyzer(OSA) - used with wavelength division multiplexing
to ennsure that eachh channel has sufficient power.
