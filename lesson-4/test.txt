BOOK 4A

1) Which step has been omitted from the following list of activities related
to identifying the problem? Gather information • Duplicate the problem,
if possible • Question users • Identify symptoms • Determine if anything
has changed

Approach multiple problems individually.



2) Which three means of establishing a theory of probable cause refer to
the OSI model?

Top-to-bottom, Bottom-to-top, and divide-and-conquer approach.



3) When should you escalate a problem?

Whenever all available resources have been exhausted.



4) Which step follows “Implement the solution or escalate as necessary” in
the troubleshooting methodology?

Verify system functionality and implement preventative measures.



5) True or False? Documentation should be created only at the end of the
troubleshooting process.

False. Documentation can happen at anytime in the troubleshooting process.

BOOK 4B

1) What cabling faults would a wire map tester detect?

Open  circuits, shorts, transpositions.



2) How would you test for excessive attenuation in a network link?

Measure the insertion loss in dB with a cable tester.



3) What is the reason for making power sum crosstalk measurements when
testing a link?

Power sum crosstalk measures cable performance when all four pairs are used,
as in GbE and 10GbE.



4) Your network uses UTP cable throughout the building. There are a few
users who complain of intermittent network connectivity problems. You
cannot determine a pattern for these problems that relates to network
usage. You visit the users’ workstations and find that they are all located
close to an elevator shaft. What is a likely cause of the intermittent
connectivity problems? How might you correct the problem?

The electricity from the elevator is causing interference. We can replace the
cable with shielded pair.



5) You have connected a computer to a network port and cannot get a link.
You have tested the adapter and cable and can confirm that there are no
problems. No other users are experiencing problems. The old computer
also experienced no problems. What cause would you suspect, and what
is a possible next step?

Speed mismatch. Check the autonegotiate settings on the adapter and port.

1) A systems manager is preplanning for the event that critical servers will fail. Which of the following would be the most likely plan of action?

Replace.



2) A network technician is troubleshooting a connection from a client and decides to use the bottom to top troubleshooting methodology. Which step would the technician perform first?

Determine if hardware related.



3) A help desk operator is troubleshooting a site that is no longer responsive. Which of the following is the first step the operator should perform?

Identify the problem.



4) A help desk technician is troubleshooting communications between a client and print server. They are trying to perform the step to identify symptoms and duplicate the problem. Which of the following does NOT fall under this step?

Question the obvious.



5) A help desk technician is helping to troubleshoot a switch's connectivity issues. Users report that they are receiving a blinking amber light. This is indicative of what type of issue?

Fault detected.



6) A network operator is troubleshooting connectivity issues and suspects the transceiver. What should the network operator perform?

Use a loopback tool



7) A network technician is trying to troubleshoot attenuation and measure accordingly. What unit of measurement expresses attenuation?

dB



8) A help desk operator is troubleshooting a site that is no longer responsive. Which of the following is the last step the operator should perform?

Document findings.



9) A network operator is trying to troubleshoot kinks and imperfections in cabling that could affect performance. What should the network operator use to test the cabling?

TDR



10) A help desk technician is trying to troubleshoot the end of a cable but is uncertain where the other end is. What could the technician use to help find the other end of the cable?

Fox and hound.
