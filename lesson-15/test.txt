BOOK 15A

1) What mechanism does RTS/CTS support?

CSMA/CA. Rather than try to detect collisions, a wireless station indicates its
intent to transmit by broadcasting an Request to Send (RTS) and waits to receive a
Clear to Send (CTS) before proceeding.



2) Which IEEE WLAN standards specify a data transfer rate of up to
54 Mbps?

802.11a and 801.11g



3) What options may be available for an 802.11n network that are not
supported under 802.11g?

Channel bonding
Multiple Input Multiple Output
Use of either 2.4GHz or 5GHz bands



4) True or False? Stations with 802.11ac capable adapters must be assigned
to the 5 GHz frequency band.

True. 802.11ac is designed to work only with 5GHz and 2.4GHz for legacy clients.



5) Which frequency band is less likely to suffer from co-channel
interference?

5GHz



6) What standard(s) are intended to support 4G mobile wireless services?

LTE, Long Term Evolution.

BOOK 15B

1) What value is used as the BSSID?

The MAC of the AP.


2) True or False? Suppressing transmission of the WLAN beacon improves
security.

False. We can still find the ssid through other devices.



3) What is a heat map?

A reading of signal strength in an area.



4) True or false? To support client roaming within an extended service
area, each access point must be configured with the same SSID, security
parameters, and Wi-Fi channel.

True.



5) What type of AP requires a wireless controller?

Thin AP.



6) What are the advantages of deploying a wireless mesh topology over an
IBSS?

Mesh topologies are more scaleable and do not require a controller. 802.11s
devices can directly connect to one another.

BOOK 15C

1) You are planning WLAN for an office building with an attached
warehouse. Where would you recommend placing Wi-Fi antennas for the
best coverage in an office full of cubicles as well as in the warehouse?

Mounted on the ceiling with a vertical type antenna.



2) The lobby area of your office building has undergone a renovation, the
centerpiece of which is a large aquarium in the middle of the room,
separating a visitor seating and greeting area from the reception desks,
where the AP facilitating guest Internet access is located. Since the
renovation, many guests have been unable to connect to Wi-Fi from the
seating area. Could the aquarium really be the cause, and what solution
could you recommend?

Yes, glass, mirrors, and water refract, reflect, and absorb radio waves.
We can place the AP above the aquarium or add another AP to the other side
of it to act as a repeater.



3) What is the difference between a Wi-Fi analyzer and a spectrum
analyzer?

WiFi analyzers filter out all signals but WiFi signals, spectrum analyzers
read all sorts of signals.



4) Users in the corner of an office building cannot get good Wi-Fi reception.
Your office manager doesnʼt want to use his budget to purchase a new
AP. Heʼs noticed that the power level control on the AP is set to 3 out of 5
and wants to know why turning up the power isnʼt the best solution?

Turning the power level up may cause compatibility issues with clients, which
in turn would lead to packet sending errors and retransmission. The best idea
hhere is to pay out for another AP or configure a wireless bridge with
directional antennas.

BOOK 15D

1) What is the main difference between WPA and WPA2?

WPA2 uses AES.



2) What configuration information is required on an access point to
authenticate users joining the wireless network against a network
authentication server?

The authentication method must be set to enterprise and the AP must be
configured with the IP address and shared secret of the RADIUS or
TACACS+ server.



3) Widget Corporation has provided wireless access for its employees using
several APs located in different parts of the building. Employees connect
to the network using 802.11g-compatible network cards. On Thursday
afternoon, several users report that they cannot log on to the network.
What troubleshooting step would you take first?

Check device compatibility with authentication methods.



4) Why might an attacker launch a disassociation attack against an access
point?

DoS attack to prevent network access, or an attempt to use an evil twin/rogue
AP to intercept network traffic.



5) Your company has a lobby area where guest access is provided so that
visitors can get Internet access. The open guest WLAN is currently
connected to the production network. The only protection against
visitors and hackers getting into the organizationʼs data is file and
directory rights. What steps should be taken to provide guest access and
better protect the organizationʼs data?

The guest WLAN should be separated on another network segment using VLANs
and a firewall to separate traffic. Configuring a captive portal would be
helpful as well.

1) The IEEE 802.11 standards use two frequency bands. Which of the following
statements regarding the frequency bands are true? (Select all that apply.)

The 2.4 GHz band is ideal for providing the longest signal range.
The 5 GHz band supports a high number of individual channels.



2) What standards is WiFi based on?

802.11



3) A wireless installer is networking a conference room with 9’ ceilings. What
is the best type of antenna for wireless devices?

Vertical rod



4) An administrator is investigating issues with users experiencing minimal
connectivity to the wireless network. The administrator has verified that the
access point configurations and uptime are correct. However, the administrator
suspects that there may be other issues causing the problem. What are some
areas the administrator should investigate? (Select all that apply.)

Signal strength
Interference
