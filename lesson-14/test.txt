LESSON 14 TESTS - SUPPORTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING SECURE NETWORKS

BOOK 14A

1) What type of security configuration uses edge and choke firewalls?

A screened subent. The edge or screening firewall if the public interface while
the choke firewall is the LAN interface.



2) What parameters in packet headers can a layer 3 firewall ruleset use?

IP source and destination address, protocol, and port number.



3) Why would you deploy a reverse proxy?

To publish a web application without directly exposing the servers on the
internal network to the internet.



4) What type of security control uses an attestation report?

NAC server configured to allow connections only to clients that meet a health
policy, such as running the most up-to-date OS version/patches.



5) How does placement of an IDS sensor assist with a defense in depth
policy?

IDSes are placed behind firewalls to detect anything the firewall may have
missed.

BOOK 14B

1) You are planning to reconfigure static and DHCP-assigned IP addresses
across the network during scheduled downtime. What preliminary step
should you take to minimize connectivity issues when the network is
reopened?

Ensure that clients obtain a new DHCP lease by shortening the lease period in
advance or by using a script to force clients to renew the lease at strtup.



2) If a network adapter is using the address 169.254.1.10 on a host
connected to the LAN, what would you suspect?

That the DHCP server is down, this is an APIPA address.



3) Following maintenance on network switches, users in one department
cannot access the companyʼs internal web and email servers. You can
demonstrate basic connectivity between the hosts and the servers by IP
address. What might the problem be?

This is a name resolution problem. Because the admin can ping by IP but not
otherwise indicates that users lost access to the DNS server from a VLAN
configuration.



4) You are troubleshooting a connectivity problem with a network
application server. Certain clients cannot connect to the service port.
How could you rule out a network or remote client host firewall as the
cause of the problem?

With no host firewall ruunning, scan or connect to the service port interface
with netcat or nmap.



SCENARIO (Page 337)

You are staffing the network help desk and dealing with support requests as they
arrive. Your network uses four access switches to support four subnets. One subnet
contains network servers (authentication, directory services, DNS, and DHCP) and
another contains Line of Business (LoB) application servers, for sales and order
processing. There are two client subnets, serving different floors in the building.

1) You receive a call from the user of host A who has always been able to
connect to the LoB application servers, but today she is unable to connect.
You verbally check with other users and discover that none of the hosts
on subnet 20 can connect, but that users in subnet 10 report no problems.
What tests should you perform to narrow down the cause of the problem?

Either the link to thhe router from subnet 20 has failed, or hosts in subnet 20
are no longer receiving a correct IP configuration from the network servers. To
test, from any host in subnet 20 we should ping the loopback address and then ping
that hosts address. If these fail, or the host is using APIPA, investigate
communications with the network servers. If local IP config is good, ping the
router. If all else fails, check the switcth or cabling.



2) You send a junior technician to the equipment room to fix the problem.
Sometime later, another user from subnet 20 calls complaining that he
cannot connect to the Internet. What questions should you ask to begin
troubleshooting?

Ask if the user can connect to one of the LoB applications. If this fails, we can
check whether other users are experiencing the issue and establish scope.



3) You asked a junior technician to step in because your manager had
asked you to deploy a wireless access point on the network to support
a sales event due to start the next day. There will be lots of guests,
and your manager wants them all to have Internet access. You did not
have much time, so you simply added the access point to the switch
supporting subnet 10. The next day arrives, and sometime after the
sales event starts, multiple employees in subnet 10 report that when
they attempt to connect to the network, they get a message that the
Windows network has limited connectivity. What might be the cause and
what test should you use to confirm the issue?

The most likely cause is that guest devices have exhausted the DHCP address pool
for that scope. The question mentions "Windows", so we can confirm that this is
the issue if the clients within the subnet are receiving APIPA addresses. We
can verify this with ipconfig.

ONLINE

1) A user is attempting to access a government network, but the network will not
allow the user’s device to connect until the user updates the operating system.
What kind of defense mechanism is this?

Network Access Control (NAC). NAC authenticates endpoints at the point they
connect to the network, and can ensure clients are running an authorized OS and
have up to date patch and security configurations.



2) An administrator received an alert regarding suspicious activity on the
network. The system is logging the activity and the administrator must determine
how to handle the situation. What kind of system most likely sent the alert?

Intrusion Detection System (IDS). IDSes perform real-time analysis of network
traffic and application logs. It raises an alert and can log activity when it
detects suspicious activity.



3) An administrator is configuring a firewall at the Session layer of the OSI
model. What kind of firewall is the administrator implementing?

Stateful inspection firewall. This is a layer 5 firewall that checks incoming
packets to confirm whether it belongs to an existing connection.



4) An organization is using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to
centrally manage IP addressing. All clients on the network are receiving IP
address autoconfiguration except the clients on a new subnet. What is the most
likely reason?

The router on that subnet doesn't support BOOTP forwarding, so traffic cannot get
to the clients.



5) An administrator can ping a server by IP address but cannot ping the server by
its name. What are some areas the administrator should check to find out why the
name isn’t resolving to the IP address? (Select all that apply.)

Check the local cache.
Check the HOSTS file.
Query the DNS server.



6) An organization purchased a new router with built-in firewall features. The
administrator configured the new appliance and it worked as expected. However,
after 90 days the firewall stopped working. What is the most likely cause?

The trial period ended.



7) A Windows user is trying to remote desktop into an application server. Although
the user can ping the FQDN, they are unable to establish a connection. What is
most likely the cause?

Firewall blocking TCP/3389. The key here is "remote desktop". RDP runs on TCP/3389.



8) Which service maps ports and documents the mappings for new webserver
connections and then substitutes the private IP address for a public IP address
before sending the request to the public Internet? (Select all that apply.)

Port Address Translation (PAT) or Network Address Port Translation (NAPT) allocate
port mappings in the state table and then subtitute the private IP for the public
IP and then forwards it to the internet.



9) An administrator is configuring a new network from the ground up. Which servers
would the administrator configure as bastion hosts? (Select all that apply.)

Proxy servers
Web servers

Bastion hosts sit on the edge of a network, therefore we configure internet facing
devices as bastion hosts.



10) An administrator has plugged in a new security camera, but when accessing the
camera’s web management interface, the administrator encounters a self-signed
certificate error. What should the administrator do?

Replace the default certificate. The key here is "self-signed", so the holder is
the issuer of the cert, so thhe admin should replace his own cert.
