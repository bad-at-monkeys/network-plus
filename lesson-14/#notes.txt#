COMPARE AND CONTRAST SECURITY APPLIANCES

Network Segmentation Enforcement

Network segmentation enforcement is applied using a combination of virtual LANs
and subnets, where each segment is a separate broadcast domain. Any traffic
between subnets must be routed.

The main unit of a logically segmented network is a zone. A zone is an area of
the network where the security configuration is the same for all hosts therein.


Firewalls typically control traffic between zones.

If a virus were to infect one VLAN, it shouldn't be able to infect other VLANs.
I should be routed through a firewall that is protecting the zone.


Internet-facing hosts accept inbound connections from the internet. Internet-
facing hosts are placed in the perimeter network zone, so that way traffic
cannot pass through the host directly.

Perimeter networks enable external clients to access data on private systems,
like web servers, without compromising security.

When communication is required for either side of the perimeter network, a host
within the zone can serve as a proxy. So the proxy will take the request from
outside of the zone and process it, whhether it be ligitimate or not.

Bastion hosts in the perimeter are not fully trusted by the internal network due
to potential compromise from the internet.





---
Screened Subnets

Perimeter networks require configuration on the external interface and internal.

Screened subnets use two firewalls placed on either side of the perimeter
network zone.

The edge firewall screens traffic incoming from the external interface and
allows the permitted traffic into the perimeter zone subnet.

Internal firewalls filter communications between hosts in the perimeter and
hosts on the LAN. This is the choke firewall, a purposefully narrow gateway
that facilitates better access control and easier monitoring.

The zone between the Screening Firewall and the Choke Firewall is the DMZ/Edge/
Extranet.


We can accomplish similar security with a single firewall with three network
interfaces. This is a triple homed firewall.

One interface is the public one.
Another is the perimeter subnet.
The third connects to the LAN.

We use routing and filtering rules to determine what traffic is forwarded.





---
Firewall Uses and Types

Firewalls are used to filter certain types of traffic.


Packet Filtering Firewalls

PF firewalls are configured by specifying an ACL. Each rule defines a specific
type of data packet and what to do when certain types of packets pass through.

Packet filtering firewalls operate at layer 3 and inspect IP packet headers.
These IP packet headers include:
  -> IP filtering; accepting or denying traffic based on its source and/or
     destination IP address.
  -> Protocol/ID type; TCP, UDP, ICMP, routing protocols and etc.
  -> Port filtering/security; accepting or denying a packet based on source and
     destination port numbers (TCP or UDP application type).


ACLs may be designed to control only inbound, or both inbound and outbound.
This is known as ingress and egress traffic fiktering.

PF firewalls are stateless, so they dont preserve information about the
connection between two hosts.

Stateless firewalls have disadvantages:
  -> Each packet is analyzed independently; attacks spread over a sequence of
     packets can slip by.
  -> Traffic flow problems; due to the above.



Stateful Inspection Firewalls

Stateful inspection firewalls address the issues of stateless firewalls by
mainting information about the sessions established between hosts.

State tables are what store this information.

Stateful firewalls operate at layer 5 of the OSI model (Session).

When a packet arrives, it confirms whhether it belongs to an existing
conneciton. If it doesn't, it will apply the ordinary pf rules to determine
whether to allow it. Once a connection has been allowed, the firewall allows
traffic to pass throughh unmonitored to preserve processing effort.





---
Firewall Selection and Placement

There are appliance firewalls dedicated to being firewalls, and then there are
software firewalls protecting individual hosts. Thee are also firewalls at the
layer 2virtual wire transparent firewall.

There are routers with firewalls builtin.

Some layer 3 switches support packket filtering.





---
Proxy Servers

A proxy server forwards requests and responses on behalf of its clients.

Proxies deconstruct each packet, preforms packet analysis, then rebuilds the
packet and forwards it on if it passes conditons.

We place proxies in a perimeter network.



Forward Proxies

A forwarding proxy server provides for protocol-specific outbound traffic.

The main benefit of a proxy is that all clients on the network have to go
through a single point, which allows for great traffic control but terrible
failover.

There are transparent and non-transparent proxy servers.

Nontransparent means that the client must be configured with the proxy server
address and port number to use it.

8080 is the typical port to connect to.

Transparent proxy intercepts client traffic without the client having to be
reconfigured. These must be implemented on a switch or router.



Reverse Proxies

Reverse proxy servers provide for protocol specific inbound traffic.

Application servers should not be placed in the perimeter network. Instead, we
deploy a reverse proxy and configure it to listen to client requests from a
public network and create the appropriate request to the internal server on the
corporate network.





---
NAT

NAT was devised as a way of freeing up IP addresses for hosts needing internet
access.

NAT is the service that provides translation between local addressing scheme
used by hosts on the LAN and the public addressing scheme used by an internet
facing device.

NAT is configured on a border device like a proxy, router, or firewall.

NAT is not a security mechanism; this function is provided by the router
or firewall ACL.





---
Port Address Translation

PAT is a means for multiple private IP addresses to be mapped onto a single
public address.





---
Defense in Depth

Defense in depth refers to placing security controls throughout the network, so
that all access attempts are authenticates, authorized, and audited.

Defense in depth may consist of additional network segmentation and screening,
network access control, honeypots, separation of duties, and intrusion detection.



Network Access Control

NAC is a system for authenticating endpoints at the point they connect to the
network using 802.1x port security, EAP, AAA model of supplicants, network
access device AAA clients, and AAA servers.

NAC enables devices to be authenticated when they connect to switch ports,
wireless networks, or VPN remote access servers.

NAC can authenticate a client based off of machine certificates and user
passwords. NAC can even support health policies that prove whether a client
is running an up to date system and meets certain standards.



Honeypots

A honeypot is a computer system used to attract attackers, with the intention of
analyzing attack strategies and tools, to provide early warnings of attack
attempts or to even divert attention from actual computer systems.

Honeypots can also detect internal fraud, snooping, or malpractice.

Honeypots are most likely placed in a protected, untrusted area between the
internet and the private network or on a closely monitored and filtered segment
within the private network itself.



Separation of Duties

This is establishing checks and balances against the possibility that critical
systems or procedures can be compromised by insider threats.

Dividing duties to their respective departments and individuals prevents ethical
conflicts or abuse of powers.





---
Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems

IDSes preform real-time analysis of wither network traffic or system and
application logs.

IDSes are configured with signature patterns, not ACLs.

Each pattern represents a known type of malicious activity.

An IDS must be configured with a sniffer to read frames from a mirrored port
or TAP.

IDSes are typically positioned behind a firewall so that it can detect
suspicious activity that the firewall didn't block.

IDSes are passive, do not slow down traffic, and are invisible to the attacker
because it doesn't even have an IP address on the monitored network segment.


IPSes provide active response to any network threats that it matches.

One thing they can do is end a session by sending a TCP reset packet to the
attacking host. Another option is for the sensor to apply a temporary filter on
the firewall to block the attacker's IP address (shunning).

Advances measures include throttling bandwidth to attackers, applying complex
firewall filters, and even modifying the suspect's packets rendering them
harmless. The appliance can even run a script or 3rd party software to preform
an action it otherwise cannot.

IPS functionaility is builtin to most modern firewalls, appliances, and proxy
servers. IPS enabled firewalls are in-line with the network, which means all
traffic passes through it.

TROUBLESHOOT SERVICE AND SECURITY ISSUES

---
DHCP Issues

DHCP Server Scope Exhaustion Issues

Possible reasons for a client to fail to obtain a lease:
  -> The DHCP server is offline.
  -> DHCP scope exhaustion.
  -> The router between the client and DHCP server doesn't support BOOTP
     forwarding.



Rogue DHCP Server Issues

If two DHCP servers are running on the same subnet, clients could end up with an
incorrect IP configuration because they have obtained a lease from a rogue
server.

Attackers can use rogue DHCP servers to change the default gateway and/or DNS
resolver addresses on the subnet and route communications through their machine.
This is called an on-path attack.





---
Name Resolution Issues

Name Resolution Methods

  -> Check local cache.
  -> Check the HOSTS file.
       for windows - %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\
       for linux - /etc/hosts
  -> Query DNS.



DNS Configuration Issues

If a host is accessible by IP but not hostname, there is a resolution problem.
To verify this, we must edit the host file and place the correct name and IP
address record in the file for the test host. If we get a successful ping, then
it suggests a nname resolution issue.

If a single client is unable to resolve names, the issue is likely to lie within
the client configuration:
  -> The client has been configured with either no DNS server addrss or the
     wrong DNS server address. We must reconfigure the DNS server address.
  -> The client has the incorrect DNS suffix. Verify client and host domain
     configuration matches.





---
VLAN Assignment Issues

Each VLAN is a discreet broadcast domain, so we must ensure that the services
using such technology (DNS and DHCP) are properly available to all VLANs.

If devices on serparate VLANs are trying to communicate, we must ensure routing
is properly configured between them.

If a device is placed in a designated VLAN, its IP configuration must be
appropriate in terms of IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS
servers.

We must also make sure the correct devices were placed in the correct VLANs.





---
Unresponsive Service and Network Performance Issues

Causes to consider:
  -> The application or OS hosting service has crashed.
  -> The server hosting the service is overloaded. Throttle client connections
     until hardware can be upgraded.
  -> Congestion in the network. Use ping or traceroute to check the latency of
     the link.
  -> A broadcast storm is causing loss of bandwidth on the network. This is
     caused by loops from switches not configured with STP.
  -> Network congestion may suggest that the service is being DDoSed.





---
Misconfigured Firewall and ACL Issues

Accidentally blocking services, ports, or addresses on the ACL will certainly
cause issues. If we put a DENY ALL rule at the top of our iptables config,
nothing will ever be able to connect to the device.

Attempting to establish a connnection from systes in and outside the firewall
can help determine causes.

The alternatiive to this is that youur firewall may bbe letting packets through
that we actually intend to block.





---
Untrusted Certificate Issues

Clients will typically notify the user if a cert is bad. Thhis is usually because
the cert issuer is not trusted.

If we actually trust the issuer, we can add them to the trusted list in Windows
cert.mgr. In Linux, certificates are stored in various directories.

Other causes of untrusted certs:
  -> Cert subject name does not match the URL. We can confirm the certs common
     name by trying to access the page with that URL.
  -> Thhe cert isn't being used for its stated purpose. A certificate described
     for email is being used for a web server, this is an issue.
  -> Time incorrectly synced between server and client.





---
Other Common Issues

NTP Issues

Authentication, authorization, and logging mechanisms depend on a synchronized
time source. NTP is that time source on UDP/123. On Windows:
  > w32tm /query/configuration

On linux:
  $ cat /etc/ntp.conf



BYOD Challenges

Bring Your Own Device is a device model thhat allows users to use personal
devices on the business network. Compatibility and support challenges arise from
such policies for obvious reasons.



Licensed Feature Issues

Licenses expiring, etc.
