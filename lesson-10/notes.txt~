EXPLAIN THE USE OF NETWORK ADDRESSING SERVICES

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

DHCP automatically assigns IPs, subnet masks, and opt params like the
default gateway and DNS server addresses when a host joins the network.

The DHCP client and server go through the DORA process:
  -> Discover
     Broadcasts a discover packet to find the dhcp server.
  -> Offer
     The DHCP server gives an IP config offer.
  -> Request
     The client requests a configuration (typically the offer).
  -> Ack
     The server acks the request and the lease is set on the client config.

DHCP Server Configuration

A DHCP server must be allocated a static IP and configured with a pool of
IPs, subnets, and opts to allocate as configuration values for clients.

To define the scope we must give the start and end of the IP range and
a subnet mask. Scopes to subnets is a 1:1 mapping.

The DHCP server must be placed within the same scope as its clients.
Advanced DHCP servers can operate multiple scopes.





---
DHCP Options Configuration

A client can renew a lease when atleast half the lease (87.5%) is up so that
it may keep the same IP configuration.

If the renew fails, the lease is released and the DORA process starts.


Short lease periods are good for networks with low IP supply and frequent
outside outside devices.



DHCP Options

Each opt is identified by a tag-byte or decimal value 0-255 (neither 1 or 255
can be used). Some opts include:
  -> The default gateway
  -> The IP address(es) of DNS servers that can resolve name queries.
  -> The DNS suffix (domain name) of thhe client.
  -> Time sync(NTP), file transfer(TFTP), or VoIP proxy.





---
DHCP Reservations and Exclusions

IP retainment isn't guaranteed.

We can guarantee a device keeps its IP if it is defined statically outside
of the DHCP scope.

An alternative way to do this is to set a DHCP reservation on that address.
The reservation is a mapping of MAC address(iface ID) to a specific IP
within the DHCP pool.

The DHCP server will always provide the same IP for that device in this way.





---
DHCP Relay and IP Helper

Each broadcast domain must be served by its own dhcp server.
This is because routers do not forward broadcast traffic.

DHCP relay agents resolve this issue. The DHCP relay intercepts broadcast dhcp
frames, applies a unicast address for the appropriate DHCP server, and forwards
them over the interface for the subnet containing the server.

Routers that provide dhcp relay services are RFC 1542 compliant.


The DHCP relay also performs the reverse process of directing responses from
the server to the appropriate client subnet, otherwise known as the IP
helper functionality.

IP helper can be configured to allow set types of broadcast traffic
(including DHCP) to be forwarded to an interface.

The IP helper function suppoorts the function of the DHCP relay.


To enable forwarding of DHCP broadcasts on the interfaces serving the client
subnets:

# interface eth1
# ip helper-address 10.1.0.200
#
# interface eth2
# ip helper-address 10.1.0.200
