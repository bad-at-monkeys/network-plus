EXPLAIN THE USE OF NETWORK ADDRESSING SERVICES

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

DHCP automatically assigns IPs, subnet masks, and opt params like the
default gateway and DNS server addresses when a host joins the network.

The DHCP client and server go through the DORA process:
  -> Discover
     Broadcasts a discover packet to find the dhcp server.
  -> Offer
     The DHCP server gives an IP config offer.
  -> Request
     The client requests a configuration (typically the offer).
  -> Ack
     The server acks the request and the lease is set on the client config.





---
DHCP Server Configuration

A DHCP server must be allocated a static IP and configured with a pool of
IPs, subnets, and opts to allocate as configuration values for clients.

To define the scope we must give the start and end of the IP range and
a subnet mask. Scopes to subnets is a 1:1 mapping.

The DHCP server must be placed within the same scope as its clients.
Advanced DHCP servers can operate multiple scopes.





---
DHCP Options Configuration

A client can renew a lease when atleast half the lease (87.5%) is up so that
it may keep the same IP configuration.

If the renew fails, the lease is released and the DORA process starts.


Short lease periods are good for networks with low IP supply and frequent
outside outside devices.



DHCP Options

Each opt is identified by a tag-byte or decimal value 0-255 (neither 1 or 255
can be used). Some opts include:
  -> The default gateway
  -> The IP address(es) of DNS servers that can resolve name queries.
  -> The DNS suffix (domain name) of thhe client.
  -> Time sync(NTP), file transfer(TFTP), or VoIP proxy.





---
DHCP Reservations and Exclusions

IP retainment isn't guaranteed.

We can guarantee a device keeps its IP if it is defined statically outside
of the DHCP scope.

An alternative way to do this is to set a DHCP reservation on that address.
The reservation is a mapping of MAC address(iface ID) to a specific IP
within the DHCP pool.

The DHCP server will always provide the same IP for that device in this way.





---
DHCP Relay and IP Helper

Each broadcast domain must be served by its own dhcp server.
This is because routers do not forward broadcast traffic.

DHCP relay agents resolve this issue. The DHCP relay intercepts broadcast dhcp
frames, applies a unicast address for the appropriate DHCP server, and forwards
them over the interface for the subnet containing the server.

Routers that provide dhcp relay services are RFC 1542 compliant.


The DHCP relay also performs the reverse process of directing responses from
the server to the appropriate client subnet, otherwise known as the IP
helper functionality.

IP helper can be configured to allow set types of broadcast traffic
(including DHCP) to be forwarded to an interface.

The IP helper function suppoorts the function of the DHCP relay.


To enable forwarding of DHCP broadcasts on the interfaces serving the client
subnets:

# interface eth1
# ip helper-address 10.1.0.200
#
# interface eth2
# ip helper-address 10.1.0.200





---
DHCPv6 Server Configuration

IPv6 SLAAC locates default gateways and generates a host address with a
suitable network prefix automatically.

DHCPv6 right now is more supplemental to IPv4 DHCP. We can use it to
provide additional option settings, rather than for leases for host IP
addresses.

EXPLAIN THE USE OF NAME RESOLUTION SERVICES

---
Host Names and FQDNs

Host name - assigned to a computer by an administrator typically when the
system is being provisioned

FQDN - provides a unique ID for the host on a particular network to avoid
the possibility of duplicate host names. This is the hostname + domain suffix.


tylerbrw@u39190a389f8a59:~/Documents$ hostname
u39190a389f8a59.ant.amazon.com

u39190a389f8a59 = host
ant.amazon.com  = fqdn

NOTE: When configuring dns records, we must append the . to our fqns.


Numerous hosts may exist within a domain, but the FQDN must follow
certain rules:
  -> The host name must be unique within the domain.
  -> Thhe total length of an FQDN cannot exceed 253 chars, with each
     label no more than 63 chars.
  -> A DNS label should use letter, digit, and hyphen chars only. Labels
     should not start with hyphens. Punctuation chars like . or / should
     not be used.
  -> DNS labels are not case sensitive.





---
Domain Name System

DNS is a global hierarchy of distributed name server databases that contain
information on domains and hosts within them.

At the top of the hierarchy is the root (.).

There are 13 root level servers (A-M).

The TLDs are below the root (.biz .com .net .org etc) and are operated by ICANN.





---
Name Resolution Using DNS

-> CLIENT: queries www.amazon.com
-> LOCAL NS: not authoritative for amazon.com, withh no cached record. It is
   configured to preform recursive querying, so it contacts a root server using
   a pre-configured list of IPs.
-> ROOT NS: not authoritative for the record, but returns thhe server for the
   .com TLD.
-> .com TLD NS: .com TLD isn't authoritative but returns the name server for
   amazon.com.
-> AUTHORIITATIVE NS: is authoritative for the domain and returns the
   www.amazon.com host record.
-> LOCAL NS: the local name server caches the record and responds to the client.
-> CLIENT: the client now has an IP mapping for www.amazon.com when it caches.


Iterative lookups - meaning that the name server responds to a query with either
the requested record or the address of a name server at a lower level in the
hierarchy that is authoritative for the name space. There isn't any additional
effort to make additional queries to locate information.

Recursive lookups - means if the queried server is non-authoritative, then it
takes on the task of querying other name servers until it finds the requested
record or times out.





---
Resource Record Types

Allow a DNS name sserver to resolve queries for names and services hosted in
the domain into IP addresses.

The Start of Authority (SOA) identifies the primary authoritative name server
that maintains complete resource records for the zone.


NS Records identify authoritative DNS name servers for the zone.





---
Host Address and Canonical Name Records

A Record - resolves host to ipv4 address
AAAA Record - resolves host to ipv6 address

CNAME record - alias for an A or AAAA record. An alias can be redirected to
a different host momentarily for maintenance.

CNAMEs are good for load balancing by pointing multiple IPs to one record.





---
MX, SRV, and TXT Records

MX Record - identifies the mail server for the domain. An MX record must not
point to a CNAME record.


SRV rcord - conatins the service name and port on which a particular application
is hosted.

SRV records can be used to locate VoIP oor media servers. In Microsoft SRV
records are used to locate DCs.

TXT record - stores any free-form text used to support other network services.





---
PTR Records

PTR record - the reverse lookup record; returns the hostnname/ip mapping.

DNS Server Configuration

DNS Server Types

DNS servers are typically configured to listen for queries on UDP port 53.
Sometimes they can be configured to allow connections over TCP port 53
because this allows for larger, 512+byte transfers.

DNS nameservers maintain the DNS namespace in zones. A single host namespace
may host records for multiple domains. A single name server may manage multiple
zones.

  -> Primary means that the zone records held on the server are editable.
     A zone cann be hosted by multiple primary servers for redundancy. Since
     the records are editable, channges must be carefully synchronized.
  -> Secondary means that the server only holds a read-only copy of the zone.
     Thhis is maintained and updated through a process known as a zone transfer.
     The serial number is a critical part of the zone transfer process.

A name server that holds complete records for a domain can be defined as
authoritative. Both primary and secondary name servers are authoritative.



DNS Caching

Resource records can be configured with a TTL that determines how long a query
result can be kept in cache and updated again.

DNS caching is performed by both client and server. Clients may manage their own
DNS caches.





---
Internal vs External DNS

Internal DNS zones refer to the domains used on the private network only.
