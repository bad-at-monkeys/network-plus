LESSON 10 TESTS - EXPLAINING NETWORK SERVICES

---
BOOK 10A

1) True or False? If a client accepts a DHCPOFFER, the DHCPREQUEST packet
is broadcast on the network.

True



2) When configuring multiple DHCP servers for redundancy, what should
you take care to do?

Configure the servers with no overlapping address scopes.



3) True or False? DHCP options can be configured on a per-scope basis.

True.



4) What address is used to contact a DHCPv6 server?

Multicast. ff02::1:2



5) In a stateless environment, what sort of information does DHCPv6
provide?

The host autoconfigures an address using a network prefix provided by the
router. DHCPv6 is then used to provide the IPv6 addresses used to access
network services like DNS or SIP gateways.

BOOK 10B

1) What type of DNS record resolves a host name to an IPv6 address?

AAAA record.



2) What use is a PTR DNS record?

PTR record, reverse lookup. Maps hostname to IP address.



3) What types of DNS records have priority or preference values?

MX and SRV.



4) What type of DNS record is used to prove the valid origin of email?

SPF and DKIM. These are configured as TXT records.

BOOK 10C

1) When you configure name server addresses as part of a host’s IP settings,
do you need to specify servers that perform iterative queries only or
ones that accept recursive queries?

Recursive queries. These types of DNS servers are designned to assist clients
with queries and are usually separate from the DNS server infrastructure
designed to host authoritative name records.



2) What type of DNS service would you configure on the LAN to use a public
DNS server to resolve queries for external domains?

A forwarding service.



3) What is the function of:

$ nslookup - 8.8.8.8

Sets the nameserver as 8.8.8.8 for the query and goe into interactive mode.



4) What is the function of a dig subcommand such as +nostats?

To modify the output of the dig query.

ONLINE 10

1) ICANN is a non-profit organization that’s dedicated to keeping the Internet
secure. What does ICANN manage? (Select all that apply.)

Generic TLDs
DNS



2) A client is attempting to renew its lease with the DHCP server so that it
can keep the same IP addressing information. How much of the lease duration
has lapsed?

At least 50%. Clients can renew a lease when atleast half the lease period
has elapsed so that it may keep the same IP information.



3) A user has typed www.network.com into a web browser. The domain name server
cannot resolve the name, so it is querying other name servers to try to find
it. What kind of lookup is the domain name server performing?

Recursive. Recursive lookups mean that if the queried server is not
authoritative, it takes on the task of querying other name servers until
it finds the requested record or times out.



4) An administrator configures a new mail server to meet the organization's
goals. Which record lists the IP addresses or names of servers that can send
email from a particular domain and combats the sending of spam?

SPF. Sender Policy Framework records list the IP addresses or names of servers
that can send email from a particular domain and combats the sendign of spam.



5) An administrator is using DHCP and wants to retain centralized management
of IP addressing but needs to ensure that specific devices that supply
always-on functionality have static IP address assignments. What is the
best solution?

Create reservations. This is a mapping of a MAC to a specific IP within
the DHCP server address pool.



6) An administrator ran a command and determined that the FQDN of a client
is forbes.sales.realty.com. What is the hostname of the client?

forbes



7) An organization is using IPv4 addresses. Which of the following records
will resolve a hostname to the IP address?

A. A records are for IPv4. AAAA records are for IPv6.



8) An administrator is configuring the TCP/IP settings in workstations and
wants to use the solution with the least amount of overhead. What setting
will the administrator select?

DHCP. This automatically assigns IPs to end systems, minimizing overhead.
Static addressing increases the operating expense (overhead) of the network
because the administrator needs to invest more time in configuration, which
costs more money at the end of the day.



9) An administrator is configuring a DHCP server. What configurations must
the administrator apply to the server? (Select all that apply.)

The server must receive a static IP.
The admin must configure a scope.

DHCP is an "always on" service. Static IPs should be assigned to these types.
A scope must bbe configured. This is the pool of addresses and subnet masks
that the DHCP server issues to clients.



10) An organization has multiple subnets but is only using one DHCP server.
How is this possible? (Select all that apply.)

DHCP relay.
UDP forwarding.

DHCP relay agents provide forwarding of DHCP traffic between subnnets.
UDP forwarding is more general but includes DHCP, NTP, and other
broadcast based services.
