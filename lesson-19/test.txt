LESSON 19 TESTS - APPLYING NETWORK HARDENING TECHNIQUES

---
BOOK 19A

1) Response time on the website that hosts the online version of your
product catalog is getting slower and slower. Customers are complaining
that they cannot browse the catalog items or search for products. What
type of attack do you suspect?

DoS



2) The network administrator at your organization analyzes a network
trace capture file and discovers that packets have been intercepted and
retransmitted to both a sender and a receiver during an active session.
What class of attack has been detected?

On path



3) True or false? To perpetrate an ARP spoofing attack, the threat actor
spoofs the IP address of a legitimate host, typically the subnet’s default
gateway.

True.



4) A threat actor forces clients to disconnect from a legitimate access point
to try to force them to reconnect to an access point controlled by the
attacker using the same network name. What two attack types are being
used?

Deauthentication. Rogue AP.



5) Analysis of outgoing traffic shows connections by IP cameras to
unidentifiable domain names. What type of traffic has been detected?

This is command and control traffic between a handler and botnet of compromised
IP camera devices, often called an IoT botnet.



6) Employees have received emails prompting them to register for a new
benefit package. The link in the mail resolves to a malicious IP address.
What type of attack is being performed?

Phishing.

BOOK 19B

1) The network administrator configures a switch with custom privilege
levels and assigns commands to each. What type of best practice
network hardening will this configuration support?

Role-based access



2) A technician configures a switch with an IP address and shared secret
of a network authentication server. What type of best practice network
hardening is being performed?

Port-Based Network Access Control (PNAC) IEEE 801.1x



3) What switch configuration feature could you use to prevent web servers
in the same subnet from communicating with one another?

We can do this by configuring a private VLAN. The servers are all placed in
the same VLAN and communicate out of the VLAN/subnet via the promiscuous
port. Each server port is configured as an isolated port. The isolated ports
are not able to communicate directly.



4) What is the default rule on a firewall?

The implicit deny rule



5) Network hosts are flooding a switch’s SSH port with malicious traffic.
The switch applies a rate-limiting mechanism to drop the traffic. What best
practice network hardening control is being used?

Contol plane policing. The SSH port carries management traffic. Malicious
management or control traffic can be used to perform a denial of service
(DoS) attack against a network appliance by overloading its general purpose
CPU. A control plane policing policy protects both control and management channels against this type of attack.



6) How would a router appliance be patched to protect against a specific
vulnerability described in a security advisory?

Router OSes typically do not support patching of individual files. The whole
OS must be replaced with a new version.

ONLINE

1) A cyber consultant is brought into a department to create security procedures
and technologies designed to restrict network access at an end user device
level. What is the consultant focusing on?

Endpoint Security



2) An organization contacts the cyber security team and requests a feature to
provide secure wireless network access. Select the appropriate answers that
support this request. (Select all that apply.)

Preshared Keys (PSKs)
Captive Portal
Geofencing



3) A cyber security technician is requested to investigate a matter in which
several customers have lodged complaints about computer issues after visiting
the company site. Upon closer observation, the technician discovers that an
unknown IP address replaced the valid IP address. What type of attack occurred
in this incident?

DNS Poisoning



4) A department head contacts a cyber consultant declaring that the team is
locked out and cannot conduct any activity. While working on the system, the
consultant notices a demand for money, or the department will never get their
data back. What is this type of attack called?

Ransomware



5) A cyber security technician speaks with a department that has voiced concern
regarding tech issues. The technician discovered that the employee had received
an email containing an attachment from an outside party. Curious about what the
document contained, the employee clicked on the link. The next day, the employee
noticed that some of the software was not working correctly, and some important
documents were no longer accessible. What was likely the cause of this issue?

Malware



6) A cyber technician needs to draft a policy for the organization to mitigate
the risk from route processor vulnerabilities. What is the name of this type of
policy?

Control Plane Policing



7) A network technician needs to strengthen the security of the company network
by minimizing the amount of traffic required for the operation of the valid
network services, and no additional access to be permitted. What is the
technician placing into the network?

ACLs



8) A cyber security technician responds to a department experiencing degraded
network bandwidth, and customers call the department saying they cannot visit the
company website. What is likely causing the issue?

DDoS



9) A cyber consultant needs to modify the company's access control lists to
minimize network traffic. During configuration, the consultant can use a
command-line utility provided by many Linux distributions that allow
administrators to edit the rules enforced by the Linux kernel firewall. What is
the command-line utility used?

iptables



10) During a routine investigation of the network, the cyber specialist
identifies that an on-path attack has compromised the network. What is another
name for this type of attack?

MitM
