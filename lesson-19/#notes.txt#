COMPARE AND CONTRAST TYPES OF ATTACKS

---
General Attack Types

Footprinting and Fingerprinting

These are enumeration or information gathering attacks.

Footprinting can be done by social engineering attacks and port scanning.

We can use nmap to footrint and fingerprint.

Fingerprinting is when we can find software typwes and versions to exploit.



Spoofing Attacks

When an attacker disguises their identity or the source of network info appears
legitimate.

ARP and DNS are typically exploited by these attacks.



DoS

Causes a service at a given host to fail or become unavailable to users.





---
On-path Attacks

A specific type of spoofing attack where a threat actor compromises the
connection between two hosts and transparently intercepts and relays all
communications between them.



ARP Spoofing

ARP cache poisoning works by broadcasting unsolicited ARP reply packets, known
as gratuitous ARP replies, with a source address that spoofs a legitimate host or
router interface.

ARP has no security and all devices are in the same BC domain, they will trust the
rogue hosts comms and update their MAC:IP cache with the spoofed addresses. The
usual target is the subnet's default gateway. If the attack is successful, all
traffic destined for remote networks will be sent to the attacker.



Rogue DHCP

DHCP communications cannot be authenticated, so a host generally trusts the first
packet that it sees. A threat actor can set their machine as the subnet's
default gateway or DNS resolver.





---
DNS Poisoning Attacks

Attacks that compromise the DNS process. Typically the attacker will replace the
valis IP address for a trusted website with their own. The attacker then
intercepts all outgoing packets and bounces them to the real IP. This leaves the
victim unaware of the attack (pharming).

DNS spoofing can also be used, which directs all traffic for a particular FQDN
to an invalid IP (black hole).

DNS cache poisoning is another redirection attack, but instread of trying to
subvert the name service used by the client, it aims to corrupt the records held
by the DNS server itself.





---
VLAN Hopping Attacks

This is where traffic is sent to a VLAN other than the one the host system is in.

VLAN hopping attacks happen by someone attaching a device to the network.





---
Wireless Networking Attacks

Rogue APs

These are APs that have been installed on the network without authorization.



Evit Twins

This is a rogue AP masqurading as a real one.



Deauthentication Attacks

These are coupled with Evil Twin attacks, sending a stream of spoofed management
frames to cause a client to deauthenticate from an AP. This can provide a lot
of openings for the attacker, like interpose the evil twin, sniff out
authorization info, or preform a DoS attack against the network.

These work against both WEP and WPA.





Distributed DoD Attacks and Botnets

DDoS attacks are launched simultaneously by multiple hosts. The aim here is to
crash or lock up the host system entirely.



Distributed Reflection DoS/Amplification Attacks

This is a TCP SYN flood on steroids. The victim's IP is spoofed and open
connections are attempted with multiple servers --- those servers direct their
SYN/ACK responses to the victim server rapidly consuming the available bandwidth.



Botnets

A group of compromised hosts that can be used to launch DDoS and DRDoS attacks.
A threat actor ahs two machines as handlers used to compromise a shit ton of
zombie hosts with DoS tools.

To compromise a host, malware must be installed on the host then a remote
backdoor needs to be opened. Then the bots on the botnet can be triggered to
flood that opening.

The network established between the handlers and the bots is called a command
and control network.





---
Malware and Ransomware Attacks

Malware is simply software with bad intentions.

Tyoes include:
  -> Viruses and worms; malware concealed within the executable code of another
     process.
  -> Trojan; malware concealed within an installer package or software appearing
     to be legitimate.
  -> Potetnially Unwanted Programs (PUPs)/Potentially Unwanted Applications(PUA);
     not necessarily malicious, but bundled withh a system and accidentally
     installed.

Ransomware is a type of malware that attempts to extort money from the victim.





---
Password Attacks

Obtaining a password file, sniffing the network, social engineering, randomizers,
dictonaries, brute force, etc...





---
Human Environmental Attacks

Social engineering, phising, shoulder surfing, tailgating/piggybacking.

APPLY NETWORK HARDENING TECHNIQUES

---
Device and Service Hardening

Secur configurations involve:
  -> Change default credentials
  -> Enforce password complexity/length requirements
  -> Role-based access
  -> Disable unneeded services
  -> Disable insecure protocols





---
Endpoint Security and Switchport Protection

Disable Unused Switchports

Using the switchport command.



MAC Filtering and Dynamic ARP Inspection

We can configure MAC filtering on a switch to prevent mac spoofing.



DHCP Snooping

DHCP snooping causes the switch to inspect DHCP traffic arriving on access ports
to ensure that a host is not trying to spoof its mac address.

Only DHCP offers from ports defined as trusted are allowed comms.



Neighbor Discovery Inspection and Router Advertisement Guard

ND inspection and RA Guard mitigate spoofing and on-path attacks over IPv6.



Port Security/IEEE 802.1x PNAC

Port security refers to the 802.1x standards' PNAC. In PNAC, the switch performs
some type of authentication of the attached device before activating the port.

The device requesting access is the supplicant.

The switch (or authenticator) enables EAP over LAN (EAPoL) protocol only and
waits for the device to supply authentication data. The authenticator passes the
data to a RADIUS/TACACS+ server which verifies credentials, granting or denying
access.





---
VLAN and PVLAN Best Practices

PVLANs extend segmentation by restricting hosts within a VLAN the ability to
directly communicate to another. This is used by web hosting or cloud companies
to segregate customers. ISPs use PVLANS to isolate customer traffic.

There are three types of PVLAN ports that can be configured within a primary
VLAN:
  -> Promiscuous port; can comm with all ports in all domains within the PVLAN.
     Usually where routed and DHCP traffic gos through.
  -> Isolated port; can communicate with the promiscuous port only creating a
     subdomain of a single host only. The PVLAN can contain multiple isolated
     ports, but eachh within its own subdomain.
  -> Community port; can communicate with the promiscuous port and withh other
     ports in the same community. This creates a subdomain that can contain
     multiple hosts.



Default VLAN and Native VLAN

VLAN 1 is the default VLAN ofcourse. Never send traffic over the default VLAN.
Make sure unused ports are not assigned to VLAN 1.

Native VLANS are ones where any untagged traffic is put when receiving frames
over a trunk port.

The native VLAN is usually set to the default VLAN and should be changed.





---
Firewall Rules and ACL Configuration

ACLs are configured on the principle of least privelage/access.

Firewall rules are processed from top to bottom, specific rules at the top with
the more abstract rules towards the bottom.

DENY ALL goes at the bottom. This is te implicit deny.
The DENY ALL rule can be added explicitly.

The three main iptables chains are:
  -> INPUT; affects incoming connections.
  -> OUTPUT; for outgoing connections.
  -> FORWARD; for connections passing through the host.

To view the current status and how these chains are used:
$ sudo iptables -L -v





---
Control Plane Policing

The QoS stack distinguishes three operational layers:
  -> control
  -> data
  -> management

The control plane comprises traffic that keeps the network itself
operational which includes routing updates, ARP traffic, STP notifications,
NTP updates, QoS classification/link reservation requests, etc.


The management plane comprises traffic that allows remote administration
and monitoring of network appliances such as, ssh, snmp, NetFlow, and
syslog. Management traffic is typically directed to the appliances loop-
back address.


Contol plane policing policy is designed to mitigate the risk from route
processor vulnerabilities. Such policies use ACLs to allow or deny control
traffic from certain sources and apply rate limiting if a source threatens
to overwhelm the processor.





-----
Wireless Security

These features can be enabled to provision and secure a wireless network:
  -> PSKs; group auuthentication allows stations to connect to the network
     using a shared passphrase, which is used to generate a PSK.
  -> EAP; APs can implement a similar port security mechanism to switches.
     On the AP, enterprise authentication can be enabled. Users can
     authenticate to the wireless network against a RADIUS server using
     their regular network credential. EAP also allows for device
     authentication through certs.
  -> Captive portal; redirecting clients to a secure web page and
     accepting a use policy before connecting to the network.
  -> MAC filtering; APs can be configured with an accept or deny list of
     known MACs.
  -> Geofencing; ensures that a station is kept within a geographic area
     to access the network.
  -> Antenna placement and power levels; ensure that AP placement is
     sufficient. Note that the prescence of an unusually strong transmitter
     (30dBm+) might indicate the prescence of an evit twin rogue AP.
  -> Wireless client isolation; clients connected on the WLAN are typically
     within the same broadcast domain and can communicate with another. An
     AP can be configured to prevent this so that stations can only
     communicate via their gateway. Peer-to-peer traffic is dropped by the
     AP.
  -> Guest network isolation; guest networks are typically permitted to
     access the internet, but not the local servers on the site LAN. For
     a place like amazon, a serparate VLAN must be configured.





IoT Access Considerations

There must be measures in place to detect whether an unauthorized IoT
device has connected to the network:
  -> Perform regular audits to prevent uncontrolled deployment of smart
     devices and appliances.
  -> Ensure the admin interfaces are secured and role-based access is being
     enforced.
  -> Include all IoT devices in patch and vulnerability management audits.
  -> Isolate management and monitoring traffic for embedded systems to
     minimize access to and from the corporate data network.
  -> Audit supplier security policies and procedures.
