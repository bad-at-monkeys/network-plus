BOOK 17A

1) What types of baselines are useful when you are performing
configuration management?

Configuration and performance baselines.



2) What type of security control provisions resources and procedures to
cope with incidents that cause major service outages?

Disaster Recovery Plan



3) How is the person who first receives notification of a potential security
incident designated?

First responder



4) What configuration request would be implemented by IT services during
employee onboarding?

BOOK 17B

1) Some of the businesses near 515support have recently had break-ins
where some equipment was stolen. As news of these events spread,
it generated some concern within the organization that their physical
security measures should be reviewed and possibly enhanced. There
is currently a security guard on duty during business hours, video
monitoring of the front and back doors, and employees use plastic
badges with their name and photo to enter the building. Access beyond
the lobby area requires swiping a badge to enter the rest of the building.
What, if anything, would you recommend adding or improving for their
physical security?

Motion detectors, video monitoring on entrance/exits, smart cards for entry.



2) What technology could be used to provision security cameras without
having to provide a separate circuit for electrical power?

PoE



3) Following a security incident, the lessons learned report recommends
upgrading premises entry control to prevent tailgating. What type of
prevention control will provide the most effective solution?

A trap, vestibule, gate, etc.



4) What is a PDS, and what type of security control does it provide?

Protected Distribution Systems are hardened cable distributions. Cabling is cased
in metal housing and an alarm is triggered if breached.



5) What technology provides data security assurance during the asset
disposal phase of system life cycle?

Media sanitization

BOOK 17C

1) What type of network topology is used by IoT technologies such as
Z-Wave and Zigbee?

Wireless mesh



2) What is a principal requirement of IoT networking technologies?

Low power consumption and low latency.



3) A technician is configuring a PC with software to manage and monitor a
network of field devices. What type of host is being configured and what
factors should govern its connection to a corporate data network?

SCADA. The SCADA host may be completely separate from the corporate data network.
If connected, it should be segregated enforced with an ACL.

ONLINE

1) A network manager needs to create a document that shows detailed information
about the termination of twisted pairs in an RJ-45 or RJ-48C jack or Insulation
Displacement Connector (IDC). What is the name of this document?

Wiring Diagram



2) An organization tasked its network analyst with reviewing the system that
monitors the building's locks, intruder alarms, and video surveillance cameras.
What is the name of this system?

PACS. Physical Access Control System.



3) A network specialist reviews the organization's cellular technology and
discovers that the current contract uses a low-power system service but supports
higher bandwidth up to 1Mbps. What baseband radio technology service is the
organization using for cellular service?

LTE-M



4) A network engineer needs to decommission a server and wipe all custom
configurations. The servers are decommissioned through a process which helps
local schools receive IT equipment. What routine will the engineer use to wipe
the server?

Factory reset.



5) A company tasks its network specialist with configuring a steel shelving
system for patch panels, switches and routers, and server devices. What is the
name of this system?

Rack



6) A network consultant considers using a wireless communications protocol
mainly used in home automation but believes it could support the organization's
mission. What is the name of this protocol?

Z-Wave



7) Due to an increase in foot traffic from outside groups throughout the
building, the organization asks the security office to employ equipment that
will allow visual monitoring across the organization. What equipment would best
be suited to manage this request?

Cameras



8) A network consultant needs to create a documentation process that minimizes
the risk of unscheduled downtime by implementing changes in a planned and
controlled way. What is the name of this process?

Change Management



9) A network consultant needs to develop a plan that sets out the procedures,
tools, methods of communication, and guidelines when mitigating a problem. What
is the name of this plan?

Incident Response Plan



10) A network manager is asked to create a document that provides a detailed
diagram of the wiring and port locations for the building. What is the name of
this document?

Floor plan



11) A security consultant needs to add a security system to an office space that
triggers an alarm while someone occupies the room. What type of equipment would
the security install?

Motion detection.



12) Due to concerns of losing or misplacing equipment, the organization asks the
network office to track all electrical equipment. What will the office use to
track the organization's equipment?

Asset Tags



13) An organization tasked its network consultant with reviewing the system that
provides workflow and process automation mechanisms. What is the name of this
system?

ICS



14) A network specialist reviews the organization's cellular technology and
discovers that the current contract uses a service that provides a low-power
version of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) or 4g cellular standard and currently
has a limited data rate between 20-100 kbps. What baseband radio technology
service is the organization now using for cellular service?

NB-LTE



15) A security consultant needs to add a security system to the doors of a
secured room. What system will the security consultant install that meets the
requirement and protects against tampering?

Closed circuit
