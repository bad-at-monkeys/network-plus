LESSON 16 TESTS - COMPARING WAN LINKS AND REMOTE ACCESS METHODS

---
BOOK 16A

1) What component of a structured cabling system protects the demarc
against tampering?

Physical access control



2) What type of cable can be used to connect a CSU/DSU to a smartjack,
assuming a maximum link distance of 1m (3 feet)?

RJ-45 patch cable



3) You are connecting a SOHO network to a VDSL service using a separate
VDSL modem. What cables do you require and how should they be
connected?

Two-pair RJ-11 connectors = WAN/DSL -> Modem
RJ-45 connectors = LAN/Ethernet -> SOHO router



4) You need to cable a service that terminates at an optical network unit
(ONU) to the customer router. What type of cable is required?

Straight RJ-45 patch cord



5) Assuming that sufficient bandwidth can be provided, what factor limits
the usefulness of a microwave satellite Internet link?

Distance

BOOOK 16B

1) What step can you take to prevent unauthorized use of a remote access
server?

Define which user accounts have dial-in rights
Consider restricting access by time of day
Confifgure logging and auditing of remote access logins and attempts



2) What type of client-to-site VPN ensures that any traffic from the remote
node can be monitored from the corporate network while the machine is
joined to the VPN?

Full tunnel. 



3) What replaces the VPN client in a clientless remote access solution?

A web browser if you are running HTML5.



4) What difference does DMVPN make to a hub and spoke VPN topology?

A DMVPN allows a host to make a direct connection, rather that forward traffic
through a central hub.



5) What IPSec mode would you use for data confidentiality on a private
network?

Transport mode with ESP.



6) What is a virtual terminal?

Configuring a management IP address on the switch to connect to its CLI over the
network rather than a serial cable.

ONLINE

1) An organization tasks a network consultant with comparing costs for the
business to acquire a technology that allows data to transfer over voice-grade
telephone lines. What is this technology?

Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)



2) A network engineer wants to establish data communications over a greater
distance than a Local Area Network (LAN). What can the engineer use to gain
the desired distance?

WAN



3) A company tasks a network specialist to purchase an access solution that
uses internet access infrastructure and a secure tunnel to connect private
communications through the internet. What is this access solution?

VPN



4) A network engineer is assigned to locate and acquire a data communications
network controlled by a single organization. What is the name for this type of
network?

Enterprise WAN



5) A network architect creates a site-to-site VPN involving multiple remotes to
a headquarters site by using static tunnels configured between the remote sites
and the headquarters site. What is the name of this VPN configuration?

Hub and Spoke



6) A company tasks a network technician with installing a VPN router onto one
of the company's larger machines capable of aggregating high traffic volumes.
What is the name of this router?

VPN headend



7) An organization tasks a network engineer with purchasing an access/gateway
that extends the local network access over an intermediate public network so
a remote computer can join the local network. What access/gateway will the
engineer acquire?

Remote Access VPN



8) An organization tasks a network consultant with comparing the costs and
requirements for the various types of Carrier Ethernet. The consultant selects
a carrier ethernet that uses digital subscriber line (DSL) variants such as
single-pair high-speed DSL (SHDSL) and very high-speed DSL (VDSL) to overcome
the usual distance limitations of copper Ethernet. What type of carrier ethernet was selected by the consultant?

Ethernet over Copper



9) A network engineer installs a new Virtual Private Network (VPN) set up
dynamically according to traffic requirements and demand. What is the type of
VPN installed?

Dynamic Multipoint VPN



10) A network technician is assigned to find the fastest solution, regarding
bandwidth capabilities, closest to Local Area Network (LAN) speeds for an office
building. What is the most expensive solution the network technician can
consider?

FTTP. Fiber to the Premises.
